## DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT

Please review this Investment Advisory Agreement (“Agreement”) carefully as it sets forth the understanding between you (“Client”) and Ethical Capital LLC (the “Firm,” a Utah-registered investment adviser) regarding advisory services provided by the Firm. If you have any questions about the content of this Agreement, you should discuss them with us or your legal counsel before you sign this Agreement.

## 1. SERVICES

### 1.1 Advisory Services

The Firm will provide advisory services to Client on a discretionary basis. The Firm will direct and manage Client’s Account in accordance with Client’s information described in Section 2 below. In providing discretionary investment advice, the Firm may, without limitation (i) invest, reinvest, purchase and sell assets in the Account, and any proceeds thereof and any additions thereto, and (ii) take all other actions with respect to such assets. The Firm is authorized to manage and effect transactions in Client’s Account without prior consultation with or notice to Client. The Firm’s discretionary authority hereunder is subject only to such written limitations as Client may impose in writing.

### 1.2 Legal Services Disclaimer

The Firm does not and will not practice law or provide legal services. The Firm shall have no obligation to institute or defend any legal, administrative, or arbitration proceeding on behalf of Client or Client’s successors or assigns. The Firm will not determine whether securities held in the Account are the subject of a class action lawsuit or whether Client may be eligible to participate in class action settlements or litigation, nor will the Firm initiate or participate in litigation to recover damages on Client’s behalf for injuries as a result of actions, misconduct, or negligence by issues of securities held in the Account.

### 1.3 Tax and Accounting Services

The Firm does not and will not offer tax or accounting services and none of the fees for services hereunder relate to tax or accounting services. Client shall be solely responsible for obtaining any such services desired by Client.

### 1.4 Proxy Voting

The Firm does not vote Client proxies. Client shall be responsible for directing the manner in which proxies solicited by issuers of securities Client beneﬁcially owns shall be voted, and will make all elections relative to any mergers, acquisitions, tender oﬀers, bankruptcy proceedings or other type events pertaining to Client assets. The Firm will use reasonable efforts to forward any written or electronic proxy materials received by the Firm to Client, but shall not be liable for Client’s failure to receive or act on such materials on a timely basis.

## 2. CLIENT INFORMATION

Client agrees to provide the Firm with current and accurate information required by the Firm to provide advisory services to Client, including without limitation information regarding Client's investment objectives, time horizons, risk tolerances, assets, liabilities, income, investments, income tax situation, and estate plan. The Firm has no duty or obligation to verify or investigate the accuracy or completeness of the information provided by Client. Client will promptly notify the Firm in writing of any changes to the foregoing information, provided that no such notice will be effective until the Firm has had a reasonable opportunity to act on the revised information.

## 3. CUSTODY; BROKERAGE; EXECUTION

### 3.1 Custodian Selection

All securities transactions in the Client's account ("Account") will be executed and cleared through Altruist, which will also act as custodian of all Account assets ("Custodian"). The Firm shall select the Custodian in its sole discretion. Client will be required to execute Custodian's account documents, as requested by the Custodian.

### 3.2 Custodian Responsibilities

The Custodian shall be solely responsible for the safekeeping and custody of all assets in the Account, and for the collection of interest, dividends and other income attributable to such assets. All payments made for investment purposes should be directed to the Custodian. The Firm shall not have any custody of the assets in the Account, other than for the purposes of deducting fees from the Account.

### 3.3 Information Access

The Firm is hereby authorized to receive from the Custodian any information about the Account as may be reasonably requested by the Firm.

### 3.4 Client Instructions

Client shall instruct the Custodian to honor all instructions from the Firm with respect to transactions relating to the Account.

### 3.5 Best Execution

The Firm will undertake to seek the best execution of Client's orders, taking into consideration not only the available prices and rates of brokerage services, but also other relevant factors, such as, without limitation, execution capabilities, research and other services provided by brokers which are expected to enhance the general advisory and management capabilities of the Firm, and the value of any ongoing relationship of the Firm with such brokers, without having to demonstrate that such factors are of a direct benefit to the Client. The Firm does not guarantee that a disparity will not exist between the market prices borne by Client and market prices available if Client engages a different investment adviser or if the Firm selected a different broker or custodian.

## 4. WITHDRAWALS

Withdrawals from the Account shall be subject to (i) any obligations of Client and claims against the Account, (ii) payment of any and all fees and charges, and (iii) the Firm's assurance, in its sole judgment, that there exists (1) no prior or conflicting claim, including without limitation, any claim against the Account or the Client and (2) no legal impediment to, and no risk to the Firm from, such withdrawal. In no event shall the Firm have any liability as a result of the Custodian's failure to effect any withdrawal or transfer, or for its delay in doing so.

## 5. FEES

### 5.1 Fee Assessment

The Firm's fees are assessed and described in Addendum I. Client will be provided an invoice containing the fee(s) to be assessed, the formula used to calculate the fee(s), and the time period covered by the fee(s). Fees are payable within 30 days of the invoice date. Fees may be negotiable, and are typically waived or discounted for associates of the Firm, their family members, and pre-existing relationships. Similar services may be made available from other firms and potentially at a lesser fee.

### 5.2 Payment Methods

Fees may be paid by check or draft from US-based financial institutions, via PCI-compliant electronic payment systems/providers, or withdrawal from Client's Account maintained at the Custodian. At no time will cash, money order or similar forms of payment be accepted. The Client hereby expressly authorizes its fees to be debited from the Account and remitted to the Firm. Fees deducted from the Account will be noted on statements the Client receives from the Custodian.

### 5.3 Set-Off Rights

The Account shall at all times be subject to the Firm's right of set-off.

### 5.4 Additional Fees

The Firm's fees are separate and additional to any fees, charges, and expenses of any applicable broker, custodian, retirement plan or plan administrator, or other service provider engaged by or providing services to Client, in addition to fees charged by third parties in connection with products recommended by the Firm (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds). Such fees are detailed in applicable prospectuses or product descriptions, and Client is encouraged to read those materials. Client acknowledges that they may be able to invest in certain investment products directly pursuant to the terms of the products' prospectuses, and that direct investments would not incur the Firm's management fees.

### 5.5 Trail and Performance Fees

The Firm does not receive "trails" or SEC Rule 12b-1 fees from investments in products recommended by the Firm. The Firm shall not receive fees based upon a share of capital gains or capital appreciation (i.e., performance-based fees) for its advisory services.

## 6. TERM AND TERMINATION

### 6.1 Agreement Term

The term of this Agreement shall be from the execution hereof to the date the Agreement is terminated according to the provisions hereunder.

### 6.2 Termination Rights

Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon prior written notice to other party. The Firm will not be responsible for investment allocation, advice, or transactional services (except for limited closing transactions) upon receipt of a termination notice.

### 6.3 Rescission Period

If Client did not receive the Firm's Form ADV Part 2 firm brochure at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to entering into this Agreement, then Client has the right to terminate the engagement without penalty within five (5) business days after entering into this Agreement. If Client terminates the Agreement after the five (5) business-day rescission period, Client is assessed fees on a prorated basis for services incurred from either (i) as a new client, the date of the engagement to the date of the Firm's receipt of the written notice of termination, or (ii) for all other clients, the last billing period to the date of the Firm's receipt of the written termination notice.

### 6.4 Fee Return

The Firm will return any prepaid, unearned fees within thirty (30) calendar days of termination. Any earned fees by the Firm in excess of a prepaid deposit will be billed at the time of termination and, if the Firm is unable to deduct advisory fees from Client's Account at the Firm's Custodian, then the Firm's earned fees will be due upon Client's receipt of the Firm's invoice.

## 7. DISCLOSURES

10. **JOINT ACOUNTS**. 

    1. If an Account is a joint account (“Joint Account”), the Firm may accept any information regarding the Joint Account and directions to effect transactions in the Account, including purchases, sales, withdrawals and payment instructions, from any Client having an interest in the Joint Account (each such Client, a “Joint Account Holder”) without requiring the authorization or consent of any other Joint Account Holder, subject to any prior contrary instructions executed by each Joint Account Holder and confirmed in writing by the Firm.

       2. Any loss resulting from the Firm’s following your instructions or from your provision of inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete information.

       

       3. The Firm’s failure to fulfil or delay in fulfilling its obligations as a result of war, insurrection, strikes, government regulations, telecommunications facilities’ failure, force majeure, or other conditions or causes beyond the Firm’s control.

You also acknowledge that you have had the opportunity to consult with the Firm and your other professional advisors or legal counsel regarding such provisions.**

    2. **You understand that certain federal and state securities laws (including the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and rules thereunder) may impose liability or allow for legal remedies even where the Firm has acted in good faith, and that your rights under those laws may be non-waivable. Therefore, you may still have causes of action against the Firm despite provisions of this Agreement that waive the Firm’s liability.** 

16. **TAXES**. Client shall provide to the Firm all documentation as may be required under applicable United States tax laws. Client agrees that (i) any amounts required by applicable law to be withheld from Client’s Account and any income derived from investments in the Account shall be withheld and paid to the United States Internal Revenue Service or other appropriate authority by the Client or any agent or issuer, as required by law, and (ii) the Custodian, or any agent or issuer, as appropriate, shall make any returns or reports to or hold them available for the United States Internal Revenue Service or other appropriate authority regarding transactions in the Account as shall be required by law.

20. **SEVERABILITY**. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineﬀective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms or provisions of this Agreement or aﬀecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions hereunder in any other jurisdiction.

**Addendum I**

**FEE SCHEDULE**

The Firm does not require a minimum account size to open or maintain an Account, nor are there account opening and/or administration fees to initiate the Firm’s services. For the beneﬁt of discounting the asset-based fee, Accounts for the same household under the Firm’s management will be aggregated. 

Fees are payable quarterly in advance, at the beginning of each calendar quarter. The fee is determined by the market value of account assets calculated on the last market day of each prior quarter’s-end, as provided in the following formula:

***((quarter-end market value) x (applicable number of basis points)) ÷ 4***

| Assets Under Management | Annualized Asset-Based Fee |
| :---: | :---: |
| $0 \- infinity | 1.00%  |

The ﬁrst billing cycle begins once this addendum is executed and account assets have settled into the Client’s Account. Fees for partial months will be prorated based on the remaining days in the reporting period in which the Firm services the Account. The Firm will send the Client and Custodian a written invoice each billing period that describes the advisory fees to be deducted from the Account at the Firm’s request. The invoice will include the total fee assessed, covered time period, calculation formulae utilized, and reference to the assets under management in which the fee had been based.

Subject to the Custodian’s fee debit procedures, advisory fees will be payable ﬁrst from free credit balances, if any, in the Account and, second, from the liquidation of any money market funds. If such assets are insuﬃcient to satisfy payment of the advisory fees, the Client will authorize the Firm to instruct the Custodian to liquidate a portion of any asset in the Account to cover the advisory fee. In addition, the Firm will charge the Client for all fees and assessments associated with checks that are returned for insuﬃcient funds. This includes, but is not limited to, custodial/clearing ﬁrm fees or charges.
