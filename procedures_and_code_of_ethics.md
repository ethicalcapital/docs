## Section 1.0 Written Procedures - General Information

The client’s best interests are the firm and all associated personnel’s primary concern. We will adhere to our fiduciary duty of loyalty, honesty, and good faith to act in the best interest of each of our clients. We may achieve this duty through avoidance of conflicts of interest or impropriety, or their appearance, and by fully disclosing all material facts concerning any conflict that may arise with respect to any client.     
    
This manual includes the firm’s Code of Ethics, oversight procedures, and policies which should be used as a reference for daily responsibilities. It is intended to assist personnel in ensuring compliance with applicable rules and regulations of the State of Utah and any applicable jurisdiction in which the firm and its representatives conduct business. Further, all personnel must be made aware that each jurisdiction in which they provide advisory services may have conflicting rules, and all personnel must ensure they adhere to that jurisdiction’s statute.  

The firm requires continual awareness of these regulations, as well as the facts and circumstances of each client recommendation. Employees will be familiar with our policies and any supplemental information incorporated within the appendices. It is a necessity for all staff to adhere to the policies and procedures identified in this manual, and that supervisors supply the necessary guidance. 

### 1.1 Use of the Manual

This manual is deemed confidential and not available for public use. It is not to be disseminated or modified in any manner without the written consent of the Chief Compliance Officer. Only the firm’s Code of Ethics extract noted within the appendices may be provided upon request to outside entities without prior approval.

This manual will be maintained in electronic format. The assigned principal will ensure the manual is reviewed on an annual or more frequent basis. Revised versions will be periodically provided and requiring previous copies to be destroyed. The Chief Compliance Officer will archive unredacted past editions for the required record retention period.

### 1.3 Application of Firm's Code of Ethics

The firm’s Code of Ethics will apply to each associated person (AP) and they will receive a copy of our Code of Ethics upon hiring, and any updates as they occur. The Chief Compliance Officer will maintain the then current copy of the firm’s Code of Ethics, as well as acknowledgements by each AP as to their receipt and agreement to abide by the our Code of Ethics, as amended.  

### 1.4 Business Description

The firm offers advisory services to its clients as outlined in its current Form ADV.  The specific advisory services and fees made available and selected will be noted in the client’s agreement. The CCO will ensure that Form ADV is kept current, and the firm’s available services and fees are accurately reflected.  Any changes to firm services and/or fee types will be made promptly, and an updated copy filed and disseminated as required.

#### Activities Not Described Elsewhere

The firm **does not** allow or participate in the following activities and, therefore, no further detail or subsequent requirements will be described in this manual involving:

- Agency Cross Transactions
- Custody of Assets
- Directed Brokerage
- Manage Unlisted Pooled Investments
- Proprietary Account Trading
- Proxy Voting
- Rebating of Fees
- Solicitor Engagements
- Wrap Program Sponsor	

### 1.5 Branch Office Locations

Only the offices listed within Form ADV Part 1 and Schedule D of Part 1 are to be used by the firm. Should the firm or any of its associates desire to operate from a branch office location other than that currently filed, the CCO will determine whether the location(s) needs to be listed on Form ADV and any necessary state filings made (i.e., Form BR or direct filing requirement) per jurisdictional statute. No less than annually, the CCO will conduct a review of each branch office location used or held out to the public by the firm. The review will be reduced to a written report and will be retained per firm policy with regard to its books and records obligations.

### 1.6 Regulatory Jurisdiction

If the firm is providing investment advisory services to individuals who reside in states other than its domiciled state, it will also be subject to statutes of each jurisdiction. Certain states allow a “de minimis” number of advisory clients in their state before registration is required (typically five or fewer clients each year) but it must be confirmed prior to offering advisory services to such state residents. The CCO will be responsible for ensuring the firm is properly registered per statute in each jurisdiction.

### 1.7 Determining Assets Under Management

When the firm calculates its reportable assets under management, it will first determine whether it provides “continuous and regular supervisory” services for each account or portfolio. The following guidelines will be considered:  

**Client Contract**: If the client contract states it will provide ongoing management or monitoring services, it implies the firm provides these services for accounts.  

**Compensation:**  If the firm is compensated based on the average value of the client’s assets it manages over a specified period, then the firm provides continuous and regular supervisory or management services for the account or portfolio.  

**Account Authority**:  The firm may be deemed continuous and regular supervisory or management services to an account or portfolio if the firm generally:

* has discretionary authority to allocate client assets among various securities, including mutual funds;  
* does not have discretionary authority but provides the same allocation services and satisfies the criteria set forth in the question regarding the client agreement regarding the determination of whether it provides continuous and regular supervision and management (i.e., implied activity);   
* allocates assets among other managers (i.e., “manager of managers”), but only if it has discretionary authority to hire and fire managers and reallocate assets among them.

The firm believes it is not deemed to have provided continuous and regular supervisory services for an account or portfolio if it generally: 

* provides only impersonal investment advice (i.e., market newsletters);  
* provides market timing recommendations (i.e., to buy or sell) but has no ongoing management responsibilities;  
* provides only an initial asset allocation without continuous and regular monitoring and reallocation (i.e., periodic investment consultation services); or   
* provides advice on an intermittent or periodic basis, such as upon client request, in response to a market event, or on a specific date (i.e., review and adjusted quarterly).

If the firm were to be compensated based upon the time spent (i.e., hourly fees) with a client during a client visit or the firm is paid a retainer for developing a financial plan, it would suggest that it does not provide continuous and supervisory or management services for the account or portfolio. 

The valuation of AUM may include accounts or portfolio values for those that qualify as “securities portfolios.”  An account or portfolio is considered a “securities portfolio” if at least 50% of the total value of the account and/or portfolio consists of securities or cash and “cash equivalents.”  

For reference, if a portfolio is (a) considered a “securities portfolio,” and (b) receives “continuous and regular supervision and management,” the entire amount may be included in the calculation of the firm’s total assets under management.  

The firm will include associated and related persons’ assets in this calculation if they are managed by the firm at its custodian of record.

The CCO will determine assets under management based on the current market value of the assets within 90 days prior to the date of filing of its Form ADV (or any earlier amendment). The firm may determine market value using the same method it uses to report account values to its clients.

### 1.8 Appointment of Chief Compliance Officer

The principal noted in the appendices serves as Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and is deemed by the firm to be an individual with adequate experience and understanding of the rules and regulations that apply to a registered investment adviser firm. Certain functions may be outsourced to legal counsel, industry consultants, or other supporting third parties, however, they ultimately remain the responsibility of the Principal(s) as delineated. Any change of the firm’s CCO must be promptly reported in writing and/or via Form ADV amendment, preferably within 10 days of occurrence and not later than 30 days. 

### 1.9 Segregation of Duties 

The ability to allow for segregation of all duties is infeasible given the current business and staffing model and, therefore, is recognized as a conflict of interest. The CCO will ensure oversight responsibilities and timely, accurate recordkeeping, as well as outsourcing certain functions where able, to assist in mitigating known or perceived conflicts.  Consideration may be made in identifying conflicting responsibilities to clients, where applicable, via pertinent section(s) of the firm’s current advisory brochure.

## Section 2.0 Regulatory Filings

Investment Adviser Registrations

The Investment Adviser Registration Depository is an electronic filing system developed for investment advisers and sponsored by the SEC and NASAA, with FINRA presently serving as its operator. The IARD provides the ability to monitor and process investment adviser information via a centralized system. It supports electronic regulatory filing and public disclosures, as well as creates a fee payment and annual renewal processing platform. Most forms can be updated electronically, and firms and IARs are typically registered to conduct business in most states and certain U.S. protectorates through IARD.  

Access to the system is made through an entitlement request from FINRA. Additional firm users will be assigned and maintained by the firm’s Super Account Adminstrator (SAA). Due to the sensitivity of the information made available to IARD users, access will be limited and controlled by the CCO.  
   
States that participate in the IARD system typically require fees be made via the firm’s account (E-Bill system) provided through FINRA CRD/IARD. Jurisdictions that do not participate in the use of the IARD for the registration may require fees be sent directly to their securities administrator.

### 2.1 Form ADV

The IARD allows for the electronic filing of Form ADV as well as the upload, retirement or termination of the firm’s advisory brochure.

**Form ADV Part 1A** describes the investment adviser's business operations, entities or persons that own or control the investment adviser, and whether the firm or its APs have been disciplined for violating securities laws, industry regulations, etc. It is completed in electronic format, filed, and amended through the IARD system.

**Form ADV Part 1B** is a continuance of Part 1A for state investment advisers and contains additional information about a firm relative to their line of business.

**Form ADV Part 2A** (advisory brochure) or **Form ADV Part 2A – Appendix 1** (wrap fee brochure) is a written disclosure statement that provides information about the firm’s business practices, fees charged, adviser conflicts of interest, code of ethics, etc.  

**Form ADV Part 2B** is a written advisory personnel brochure supplement that provides information about the firm’s investment adviser representatives, any reported disciplinary history, their outside business activities, other income they may receive, assigned supervisor, etc.  

Should at some point in the future the firm decide to withdraw from being an investment adviser altogether or from certain states, it would file a **Form ADV-W**.  

* Partial Withdrawal is completed if the firm is withdrawing its investment adviser registration with some, but not all, of the jurisdictions where it is registered or has an application for registration pending; or switching from state registration to SEC registration (or vice versa).   
* Full Withdrawal is completed when the firm is withdrawing from all of the jurisdictions in which it is registered or has an application pending. Even if the firm is going out of business, it must file the ADV-W prior to doing so to notify regulatory authorities.   


#### 2.1.1 Form ADV Maintenance

The firm will update its Form ADV Part 1 on an annual basis, and not later than 90 days following its fiscal year end.  The CCO or assigned designee will ensure the filing is updated, and a copy is kept on file with the firm’s organizational matters.

Other business or operational changes that occur during the reporting period may require an “Other-Than- Annual” ADV amendment. Changes in ownership/control, addresses, advisory services, etc., typically trigger amendment requirements. The CCO will ensure changes are reported within 30 days of their occurrence.  

Form ADV Part 2 and corresponding schedules are filed via the IARD system. The firm will upload its current Form ADV Part 2 when amended and should retire previous versions in succession or as necessary. The firm will annually update its Form ADV Part 2 within the IARD.

### 2.2 Staff Due Diligence

The CCO or a designee will make a reasonable investigation of all persons applying for registration or association with the firm. Investigations should be conducted by contacting previous employers or third-party review agencies for a reasonable assessment and to determine whether undisclosed disciplinary history exists. A record of these reviews should be noted in the prospective employee’s file. If the prospective employee is transferring from another firm, a copy of their most recent Form U-5 (with amendments when applicable) should be obtained, reviewed, and held on file.

#### 2.2.1 Employee/Associate Background Checks

The firm may obtain an *Investigative Consumer Report* which may consist of information from public and private sources, public records, former employers, and references. The report may include information concerning driving records, civil and criminal court records, credit, worker’s compensation, education, professional credentials, personal identity, past addresses, social security number, previous employment, and personal references. The review must be conducted in accordance with applicable federal and state laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act. It is due to these requirements that the firm will consider engaging screening by a qualified third-party.  

In using the mentioned reports for employment or engagement purposes, and before the firm takes any adverse action based in whole or in part on a report, the CCO or designee shall provide a copy of the report to the person to whom the report relates and a description in writing of their rights, as prescribed by Federal Trade Commission regulations.

#### 2.2.2 Registration of Personnel

Most jurisdictions where the IAR will be registered require information concerning their background via Form U-4 and transmitted via the IARD. An IAR’s U-4 filing will include the selection of each jurisdiction that requires agent registration of the IAR (“RA” in the IARD). An IAR cannot begin advisory business until the assigned principal has ensured appropriate registration per jurisdictional statute. The CCO will also ensure that the IAR conducts advisory business only in the states in which registration is maintained or exempted per statute. Effective registration may be noted by the firm’s copy of the individual's report from the IARD.

#### 2.2.3 Adverse Disclosures

APs should be interviewed by the CCO concerning any investigations or complaints, or “Yes” answers on Form U-4.  Any of the latter will require the prospective employee to be cleared by the CCO prior to an offer of employment.  The CCO will carefully review each Form U-4 for any disciplinary disclosures of alleged complaints, investigations and any “Yes” answers. The firm will require the submission of a completed DRP and supporting documentation (copies of client’s complaints, arbitration findings, etc.) for all “Yes” answers on the disclosure pages. The CCO will review each entry to ascertain whether the prospective employee presents a potential risk.

#### 2.2.4 Heightened Supervision  
    
APs with a history of adverse disclosures such as complaints, disciplinary actions, arbitrations, etc., may be subject to further supervisory scrutiny or disqualification. Heightened supervisory measures may include:

* Procedures outlining the supervisory arrangements, including an overall analysis, supervisor assigned, as well as the frequency and duration of the review period.  This information will be reduced to a written document that will be signed by the CCO, assigned supervisor, and (where appropriate) the AP subject to heightened supervision.

* AP client files and recommendations will be reviewed by the assigned supervisor, and clients may be sampled to verify information.


* Specific training covering topics pertinent to the activities for which the AP was subject to the special supervision may be assigned.

#### 2.2.5 Dual Registration

All requests for dual registration (in applicable jurisdictions) will be in writing, and reviewed and approved (in writing) by the CCO. This requirement involves both investment adviser and broker/dealer activity. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in termination. The CCO will ensure record of the approval. 

#### 2.2.6 Fingerprints

The CCO or designee will ensure fingerprint cards are submitted to those jurisdictions *where required*, such as New Jersey.

### 2.3 Form U-4 Filings

The filing of Form U-4 is typically done for the purpose of registering an individual with the firm as an IAR in each applicable jurisdiction. Nearly all US jurisdicitons mandate the use of the CRD system for processing Form U-4 filings (including New York as of 2021).  

#### 2.3.1 Investment Adviser Representative Registrations

The Series 65 and Series 66 are "criterion based" minimum competency examinations developed by NASAA and administered through FINRA. Candidates who pass one of either exams are considered to have met the minimum competency level. Completion of the exam allows for an applicant to become registered with an investment adviser within two years of the examination date (one year for Arizona residents). 

Series 65 Exam:  The Uniform Investment Adviser Law Examination is designed to qualify individuals as investment adviser representatives and discusses topics determined necessary in order to provide investment advice to clients.

Series 66 Exam: The Uniform Combined State Law Examination was developed in support of industry requests to design a format to qualify prospective employees as both securities agents and investment adviser representatives.  The exam covers topics that have been determined necessary to provide investment advice and effect securities transactions for clients.  The FINRA Series 7 is a co-requisite exam and must be successfully completed along with the Series 66 exam typically before an individual may register with a jurisdiction.  Candidates may take either exam first but must satisfactorily complete both.

#### 2.3.2 Registration Examination Waiver

As may be allowed by statute, specific professional designations maintained in good standing may preclude an IAR from having to sit for the noted exams, *but they do not exempt registration*. These may include:

* CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNERTM, CFP®  
* Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)   
* Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC®)   
* Chartered Investment Counselor (CIC)  
* Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) 

Certain jurisdictions allow for additional types of waivers due to completion of certain securities industry examinations (e.g., Series 6, 7, etc.) or entry into the industry (“grandfathering”). The CCO will confirm such waivers by jurisdiction.  In all instances, the firm (as does the jurisdiction) retains the right to require noted professional designation holders or other previously waivered personnel to successfully complete the earlier stated registration examination. In addition, the firm requires IARs have sufficient investment-related or other similar background and experience. The firm will maintain validation of the required examination(s)/waiver or an individual’s current designation, as applicable. The CCO or designee will ensure that IARs meet the requisite licensing or examination qualification criteria in each appropriate jurisdiction.  

#### 2.3.3 Amending Form U-4

As the event occurs, each AP will notify the CCO for potential Form U-4 amendment involving changes in:

* Personal identification information;  
* AP’s name (e.g., change in marital status, commonly used nickname, etc.);  
* Residential history;   
* Business address; or  
* Outside business activity.

The CCO may amend U-4’s upon receipt of any of the following:

* Client complaint;  
* Criminal disclosure;  
* Civil judicial action;  
* Regulatory matter;  
* Termination for cause; or  
* Bankruptcy/Short Sale/Reportable lien. 

Each AP will annually attest that the items noted above are current or have not changed. The firm will maintain copies of all amended Form U-4s, with the most current copy being maintained in the AP’s employment file.  

### 2.4 Form U-5 Filings

The Uniform Termination Notice (Form U-5), commonly known as the “U-5,” is used to terminate an individual registration with various self-regulatory organizations and/or jurisdictions. There are essentially three types:  

* Full Termination: A full termination U-5 is used when terminating an individual from the firm. All registrations with jurisdictions are terminated.  U-5 filings will be promptly filed after the individual has left employment.  Disclosure answers are required and residential addresses may be updated.

* Partial Termination: A partial termination U-5 is used to terminate individuals from selected jurisdictions.  Disclosure questions are not required and residential addresses may be updated.

* Amended U-5: An amended U-5 is used to update or amend disclosure, or residential information on an individual already terminated from the firm.

#### 2.4.1 Associated Person Termination

Promptly and not later than 30 days of the associated person’s termination, the CCO or designee will ensure the Form   
U-5 is filed within the IARD system. Copies of the U-5 will be provided to the IAR, with proof of delivery, and filed within terminated employee records.

**Voluntary Termination**

All APs will immediately notify the CCO or designee when they decide to voluntarily leave the firm. Regardless of the reason for termination, the CCO or designee must secure all required books and records from the associated person and, to the extent possible, ensure such records are not reproduced or removed from firm’s premises.

**Involuntary Termination**

When an associated person is terminated due to a violation of policy, unethical business practices, regulation, etc., the CCO must be immediately notified of the specific reason(s) for the termination including any alleged or actual violations. An investigation may likely ensue, not only for client protection and firm risk management purposes, but also in anticipation of potential regulatory or law enforcement response.  

Associated persons who are involuntarily terminated may be asked to leave the premises immediately and not permitted to return. Prior to or at the time of termination, the CCO or designee must ensure all books and records of the firm have been returned.

The notification regarding the termination must be objective, therefore, all U-5 entries for terminated for cause cases will be reviewed by the CCO prior to IARD submission to ensure pertinent information is stated. The CCO may also consider consultation with outside parties prior to U-5 submission when appropriate.

Timeliness of Form U-5 filings involving for cause  terminations is important and certain violations of law or regulation (i.e., fraud, forgery, etc.) may require firm notification of regulatory and/or law enforcement officials.  
   
*2.5	Associated Persons List*

Following registration and jurisdictional approval, the CCO or designee will add personnel to the firm’s Associated Persons List” or similar record. This list reflects all personnel, their registration status, IARD number, title(s), basic role(s), assigned supervisor, and office where the AP regularly conducts investment advisory business. This list should be cross-referenced from IARD reports to ensure accuracy of firm data. A historical file will be maintained for a period of five years following each reportable year.

*2.6	Employee/Associate Files*

A record may be maintained for each associated person including (***where applicable***):

* Pre-hire background check information;

* Most recent copy of the employee U-4;

* Supporting DRP documentation;

* Copy of the employee’s previous U-5;

* Copy of fingerprint cards;

* Employee attestations;

* Record of the AP’s personal securities accounts;

* Documentation and approval of the AP outside business activities;

* Compensation records and agreements between the AP and firm. If compensation is based on other factors (i.e., shares, etc.) beyond the firm’s standard AP arrangements, a description of the compensation and methodology employed should be noted;

* Relevant IARD status reports;

* Heightened supervision information;

* Disciplinary record; and 

* Terminating U-5 and proof of delivery.

*2.7	Supervision of Associated Persons* 

Whether registered or non-registered, all APs will be assigned to a supervisor. The supervisor will have responsibility for oversight of the assigned AP’s business activities. The CCO will ensure that each supervisor will have the necessary experience and qualifications to perform in the role. A record denoting assigned APs and their supervisors for the previous five years will be retained for reference.

*2.8	Business Titles*

Business titles will be accurate and avoid public misperception as to the associate’s position, education, and professional background. No title will include the term president, vice president, director, portfolio manager, etc., unless it is indicative of the associate’s role and is stated as such in the firm’s records.  

*2.9	Professional Designations*

Only those professional designations that are reflective of an associate’s role or activities with the firm will be used (i.e., AIF®, CFP®, ChFC®, PFS, etc.) on publically-disseminated materials, such as advertising, correspondence, etc.  Associates will only use those designations for which they are able to demonstrate they are in good standing via the designation’s accrediting body.  

A designation that attempts to imply a specialization to advise senior citizens, elders, retirees, government civilian employees or military personnel is restricted, and will only be approved by the CCO (in writing) upon determination of the type and quality of the designation’s initial and ongoing education program, value to advisory clients, and when approved for use by jurisdictional statute.

*2.10	Outside Business Activities*

Associates are required to disclose to the firm, in writing, of any outside business activities ***prior** to* association with the firm or engaging in such activity following affiliation. On an annual basis, associates will be required to complete a questionnaire disclosing all outside business activities (OBAs). Outside business activities may include a wide range of activities including, but not limited to, the following:

* Using an outside entity for the purposes of office leases, etc.;

* Ownership or employment with an outside entity;

* FINRA or NFA registration;

* Acting as an independent contractor to an outside party;

* Serving as an officer, director, or partner;

* Insider to an issuer of securities;

* Acting as a finder;

* Referring someone and receiving a referral fee; 

* Receiving direct or indirect compensation for services rendered outside the scope of association with the firm; or

* Serving as trustee of a trust or general partner of a partnership, limited liability entity, or pool of any kind.

Compensation may include salary, stock options or warrants, referral fees, or providing or discounting of services or products as remuneration. Generally, remuneration consisting of anything of present or future value for services rendered may be considered compensation. 

The firm must be made aware of foundation or charitable activities but are generally not filed as an OBA on Form U-4 unless the associate is being compensated or serves in an investment advisory or trustee capacity that the firm believes should be disclosed.  

Associates requesting approval for, or notifying the firm of any changes to, an outside business activity must complete the Outside Business Activity disclosure and submit it to the CCO for review. New or amended roles in an OBA must be approved *prior to* engaging in the activity. Evidence of requests, approvals/disapprovals and annual attestations will be maintained in each associate file.

The firm generally does not disclose outside business activities in Form U-4 or Part 2B of Form ADV if they (i) do not involve or create a material conflict of interest between the firm and its clients, or (ii) do not result in commissions, bonuses, or other compensation as a result of the sale of a security or other investment product, or (iii) do not involve 10% or more time of the associated person, or (iv) do not involve 10% or more income of the associated person.

*2.11	Non-Compliance with the Firm’s Code of Ethics*

All associates are encouraged to promptly report any violation of the firm’s Code of Ethics or other policy to the CCO (preferably), or the senior-most member of the firm, or its legal counsel, including the discovery of a possible violation committed by another associate. Items that should be reported include but are not limited to non-compliance with state or federal securities laws, conduct that is harmful to clients or the firm, conflicts of interest, etc.  

Associates are encouraged to report any violations or apparent violations and such reports will not be negatively viewed, even if the reportable event upon further review is determined to not be a violation and the associate reported such apparent violation in good faith. 

Any associate having knowledge of a violation of the firm’s Code of Ethics and allows it to remain unreported may be deemed in violation of the firm’s Code and subject to similar sanction. 

While it is believed the firm is capable of addressing violations of its written policies and Code of Ethics, the CCO and any other associate may choose to gain further guidance from the New York Attorney General’s Office.  

*2.12	Disciplinary Sanctions*

Upon discovery of a violation of regulation or firm policies and an investigation, the CCO may impose disciplinary actions as warranted.    
Sanctions may encompass various levels including a verbal warning, letter of caution, suspension, fine, disgorgement of fees earned, and/or termination. Certain violations may require making a referral to appropriate regulatory or law enforcement agencies as required by jurisdiction.

The information in the following sections will address the manner in which the firm defines the term “client,” client disclosure requirements, and documentation for client files.  

### 3.1 Definition of a Client

The firm defines a “client” to be the following:

* A natural person; and

* Any immediate family member of the natural person who has the same principal residence;

* All accounts of which the natural person and/or the persons referred to in the previous two points are the only primary beneficiaries;

*  All trusts of which the natural person and/or the persons referred above are the only primary beneficiaries; ***OR***

* A corporation, general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, trust (other than an individual’s trust), or other legal organization that receives investment advice based on its investment objectives rather than the individual investment objectives of its shareholders, partners, limited partners, members, or beneficiaries; or

* Two or more legal organizations referred to in the preceding bullet point that have identical owners; or

* Department of Labor qualified retirement plan; or

* A government entity.

### 3.2 Client Disclosures

The IAR will furnish each client or prospective client with a current written disclosure statement (Form ADV Part 2A or wrap brochure), as well as the IAR’s brochure supplement (Form ADV Part 2B) if applicable. This disclosure must be delivered at least 48 hours prior to entering into any written contract with such client or prospective client or the client will have the right to terminate the contract without penalty within five business days after entering into it.

Within 120 days of the firm’s fiscal year-end and without charge, the firm will deliver to its clients its Form ADV Part 2A/Part 2 or offer to make delivery of Form ADV Part 2A/Part 2 and provide a summary of changes that have occurred to the brochure since its last filing. If no changes have occurred to Form ADV Part 2B \- Brochure Supplement (Advisory Personnel), it is not required to be delivered with the revised Form ADV Part 2 or its summary of changes on an annual basis.  

The delivery of Form ADV Part 2 may be made via electronic means as long as the client has previously consented in writing to receiving such communications and the firm can verify its delivery. The firm will provide its Form ADV Part 2 within seven days of the client’s request.

### 3.3 Other Disclosure Items

The firm will notify its clients through the use of Form ADV or similar document of financial or disciplinary matters that may involve the firm, its management, or control persons. Certain events, as stated under current statute, are required to be disclosed for a period of up to 10 years (or longer in certain matters) after the occurrence. Generally, financial, disciplinary, or legal events that may require disclosure would include matters not resolved in the favor of the firm or its management/control persons, or where such an event might materially impact the firm’s ability to meet certain contractual commitments with clients, or issues that would otherwise compromise the integrity of the firm. Calculating the 10 year period for issues presumed to be material, the date of a reportable event will be the date which the final order, judgment, or decree was entered; or the date which any appeal from preliminary orders, judgments, or decrees lapsed.  

### 3.4 Client Accounts

#### 3.4.1 Client Agreements

***All clients engaging the firm for its services*** will execute an agreement, including firm officers, directors, employees, and immediate family members. Among other items that may be noted in the document, the agreement should generally describe:

* Legal name of parties engaged in the agreement;  
* Types of services provided;   
* Firm fees to be charged;   
* How fees are calculated;  
* Payment terms (advance/arrears; monthly/quarterly, immediate);  
* No Assignment clause;   
* Receipt of Form ADV Part 2 and Privacy Policy;  
* Termination clause;   
* Date of agreement;  
* Client(s) signature; and  
* Officer/CCO signature.

The firm will make every attempt to update current clients’ suitability information every three years.  

#### 3.4.2 New Client Account Review and Processing

A completed client agreement and custodian application form (where applicable) will be signed by the client. The CCO will review and approve all new client agreements and account opening documents. 

All custodian-required documents will be promptly forwarded to the selected custodian for processing.  Copies of all new account documents will be made and filed as described in following sections. 

Any “above the line” (e.g., above the signature line) changes that are required for client agreements, addenda, or custodian account documents must be reviewed and approved (initialed and dated) by the client or their legal agent.

All client statements and confirmations will be sent to the client’s address of record. With the exception of firm or associate accounts, neither the firm nor any of its APs may be the sole address of record for any client documents, including accounts for immediate family members. 

#### 3.4.3 Investment Guidelines

The firm will attempt, *when appropriate*, to establish portfolio investment guidelines to assist in ensuring consistency with stated objectives and investment advisory activities provided. The document will also serve as a guide for the performance of the investable assets so that they can be compared and adjustments recommended as necessary.  

#### 3.4.4 Suitability Information

The firm will maintain written information about each client that had been used for the basis for making any recommendation or providing any investment advice. At a minimum, the client file/record will include:

* Date of birth;   
* Financial information (i.e., liquid net worth, annual salary, etc.);  
* Employment information;  
* Marital status;  
* Investment objectives;  
* Investment experience;  
* Risk tolerance, and how such tolerance had been determined;  
* Tax bracket at the time of the recommendation or subsequent recommendations; and  
* Anticipated needs of the client.

#### 3.4.5 Existing Clients

Account Changes  
IARs will promptly inform the CCO or assigned staff member of any client account information required to be updated whenever they are aware of material changes. Updates may be recorded by making revisions to existing forms, system entries, file notes, or by completing new forms. Changes to client addresses, suitability information, or standing third-party payment requests must be approved in writing by the client as well as the CCO ***prior*** to effecting such change.  

Review  
Accounts are periodically reviewed throughout the year by the CCO or on an “as-needed” basis due to a material change in the client's financial circumstances, changes in market conditions, or at the specific request of the client. It is the client's responsibility to promptly notify the firm if there is any change in their financial situation or investment objectives for the purpose of reviewing, evaluating, or revising the firm's previous recommendations or services. IARs should query clients throughout the year as to whether any noted or other information has changed or is anticipated to change in the near term. 

The firm will not be obligated to perform ongoing client account reviews for those who have engaged the firm only for services as defined in its brochure and client agreement that are “incidental in nature” (one-time service).  

*3.4.6	Client Statements and Confirmations*

The client will receive only those account statements and confirmations originating from the selected custodian, bank, or broker/dealer (“custodian of record”) engaged to serve their account. Neither the firm nor any employee or outside third-party shall be authorized to create or publish any alternative of the custodian of record’s account statement or confirmation documents.

*3.4.7	Client File Information*

The CCO or designee will ensure that every client has a record that contains pertinent client financial and investment objective information, as well as other client-specific information. Due to the services the firm provides, there are several kinds of client information that may need to be gathered and maintained.  

Prior to engaging the firm to provide advisory services, the client will be required to enter into a written agreement that sets forth the terms and conditions of the engagement, describing the scope of the services to be provided. The client agreement will also state the advisory fees agreed upon, any discounts provided and why, and how the advisory service fee will be remitted to the firm. A copy of this agreement will be kept in the client file.

The following items should be created and kept in a client file (*where applicable)*:

* Copy of the executed client agreement. Signed by the client(s) and the CCO.

* Any power of attorney, partnership agreement,corporate articles, etc.

* Evidence of the initial delivery of the firm’s disclosure documents to client (including the date that the information was provided to client). *Typically embedded into the client agreement.*  

* Financial data or work-up on the client (may include financial statements, tax returns, etc.).

* Investment policy statement or other similar record of client investment objectives.

* Any due diligence used in order to render advice to the client.

* Copies of correspondence between the firm and client, unless maintained elsewhere per CCO approval.

* Client agreement termination notices from either party, when issued.

*3.5	Matters Involving Custody*

The firm will only have custody of individual client account assets to the extent it ***may*** request a qualified intermediary (the custodian of record) to deduct firm advisory fees from a client account. The firm will not take possession of individual client account funds or securities. The following procedures are designed to ensure the firm does not inadvertently obtain further custody over client assets:

* Associates will never be granted general power of attorney for a client account;

* All securities inadvertently delivered to the firm by the client will be promptly returned (same day but no longer than three days of receipt) via secure means with written instructions on how their securities must be submitted directly to the account custodian;

* Third-party checks will be recorded and forwarded within 24 hours of receipt;  

* The firm will obtain prior written authorization from the client before deducting fees directly from the client’s account;

* Client securities will not be made or held in the firm’s name or in “bearer” form;

* Proceeds from the redemption of client securities may not be directed to the firm;

* The firm will not have signatory power over a client’s checking or custodial account (unless it is a family member joint or custodial account);

* An employee may not serve as trustee over a client’s account unless the client is an immediate family member of the employee and approved by the CCO *and is within statutory guidelines*;

* All wires from client custodial accounts to third-party accounts must be preceded or accompanied by client written authorization; and  
* Inadvertent receipt of client securities or checks will be recorded in a “checks and securities received and forwarded log” (“check log”) as well as a description of the disposition or action taken. 

*3.6	Firm Trading Policy*

Client needs and interests are paramount, and neither the firm nor any of its APs will engage in any activities that subordinate the interests of the client.  

If there are specific limitations or restrictions established by a client, it will generally be recorded in the investment policy statement or other file memoranda, and the CCO will ensure such limitations and/or restrictions are followed.   

The firm will make every effort to keep its clients informed of any information pertinent to the overall safety or status of accounts, or that may be useful for the overall financial knowledge and understanding of the client.  

The firm will observe its obligations in regard to complete and fair disclosure to its clients regarding any existing or potential conflicts of interest that may impact any trading activity on behalf of its clients.  

*3.6.1	Discretionary Accounts* 

Discretionary authority allows the firm to enter transaction orders and/or select and reject sub-advisers on behalf of a client without contacting the client or their agent prior to each transaction or adviser selection. Key aspects of discretionary account requirements include:

* Discretionary accounts require specific written authorization from the client, found within the client agreement and often also requiring use (and execution) of the selected custodian’s forms.

* Discretionary authority is permitted on a limited basis, such as the authority to buy or sell securities or select a sub-adviser. Further exceptions require prior written approval of the CCO.

* The firm will maintain a record identifying each discretionary client account and the period discretionary authority had been authorized.

The firm may provide its services on a non-discretionary basis. Clients need to be informed that such authority restricts transactions to occur until following their approval and that under this type of engagement, they must make themselves available and keep the firm apprised of current contact information so that transaction instructions can be efficiently effected. By definition, and absent written client instruction to the contrary, non-discretionary account transactions do not involve those with respect to a trade execution's price or time.

*3.6.2	Trust Accounts*

Certain trusts and other accounts governed by legal instruments may not allow the trustee or agent to re-assign any authority to a third-party (i.e., the firm) or allow the trustee to act alone in an investment decision.  Further, clearing/custodial trust certification of investment powers (TCIP) may not allow the firm adequate review of assignment authority. A copy of the trust agreement, investment powers statements (usually a section within the trust), and other legal documents should be provided to the firm for review (and record) prior to the approval of a trust or similar account, and in advance of its forwarding to a custodian when required.

*3.6.3	ERISA Accounts*

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) is a federal law that sets minimum standards for most voluntarily established pension and health plans in private industry and provides protection for individuals in these plans. A "plan fiduciary" is generally deemed anyone with discretionary authority *or* control over the management of a plan, the administration of the plan, *or* the disposition of plan assets. Fiduciaries must comply with certain statutory duties which include prudence and diversification of investments and the duty to act in accordance with the governing instruments of the plan. Generally, trading in ERISA accounts is subject to the "Prudent Investor Rule" (formerly, the “Prudent Man Rule”). Allowable transactions are governed by ERISA (and related Department of Labor and IRS rulings), the plan’s investment policy statement, and trading guidelines for the account. This measure is not judged on the risk of a single investment but by the investment's relationship to the overall portfolio. ERISA also requires that investments in a covered plan be diversified to minimize the risk of large losses unless it is clearly prudent not to do so. Any known or perceived conflict of interest involving the firm and an ERISA account must be disclosed prior to the engagement and throughout the engagement. The firm may choose to provide the conflict of interest via its current Form ADV Part 2\.

*3.6.3	Performance Review and Analyses*

Periodically, the CCO or designee will conduct a review of select accounts utilizing appropriate systems, reports, or data as may be reasonably gathered to validate the firm and/or selected sub-advisers’ strategies, recommendations, and resultant data/account values assist in the basis for current and future portfolio strategies, consideration for the selection or dismissal of certain other investment advisers, etc. Observations should ensure the accuracy of historical performance data, random selection of client accounts, inclusion of terminated accounts during the review period, among others, to produce a more definitive report, selection, and/or strategy. The CCO is responsible for documenting the performance review, including a description of the systems utilized, data analyzed, results, and assessments. The review should be recorded and maintained on file for a period of no less than five years from the date of the report.  

*3.7	Asset Selection / Portfolio Management*

The firm will seek the most favorable and appropriate asset selection and/or portfolio management techniques to achieve the desired goals of the client. On a periodic basis, the CCO will review a percentage of client accounts. The review will cover areas such as suitability, best execution (quality of execution), as well as consistency with client investment guidelines, firm trading policy, and securities law.

**Model Portfolios – *Safe Harbor***  
Rule 3a-4 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 provides a non-exclusive *safe harbor* that allows the firm to exclude certain similarly managed accounts, such as model portfolios the firm may recommend to its clients, from the definition of an investment company security (e.g., mutual fund), provided that each client receives “individualized investment treatment.” The conditions that must be met in order to fall under Rule 3a-4’s safe harbor are:

* Each client’s account must be managed on the basis of the client’s financial situation and investment objectives, and any reasonable investment restrictions the client may impose;

* The firm must obtain sufficient client information to be able to provide individualized investment advice to the client;

* The firm and/or portfolio manager must be reasonably available to consult with the client;

* Each client must be able to impose reasonable investment restrictions on the management of their account(s);

* Each client must receive a quarterly statement with a description of all account activity; and

* Each client must retain certain indicia of ownership of the securities and funds in the account (e.g., the ability to withdraw securities, vote securities if they choose to do so, etc.).

In compliance with Rule 3a-4, the CCO will ensure the firm meets the above-noted requirements in addition to providing quarterly written reminders to clients that they notify the firm of any changes in their financial situation, as well as an annual offer to clients to update their personal/account information.

*3.8	Client Directed Brokerage*

Our firm does not accommodate client-directed brokerage requests. As a result, the client may experience higher commissions or other transaction costs, experience greater spreads, or receive less favorable net prices on transactions. This information should be disclosed in Part 2A of Form ADV. 

*3.9	Aggregation and Allocation*

Trade aggregation involves the purchase or sale of the same security for several clients/accounts at approximately the same time, and may also be termed “blocked, “bunched” or “batched” orders. Aggregated orders are typically effected in an attempt to obtain better execution, negotiate favorable transaction rates, or to allocate equitably among multiple client accounts should there be differences in prices, brokerage commissions or other transactional costs that might otherwise be unobtainable through separately placed orders. When trade aggregation is infeasible and necessitates individual transactions (e.g., withdrawal or liquidation requests, odd-lot trades, difficulty building a block trade involving non-discretionary accounts, etc.), an account may potentially be assessed higher costs or less favorable prices than those where aggregation has occurred. Clients must be informed via Form ADV Part 2A of the potential costs involving independent transactions.   
The CCO will periodically review its trade procedures to ensure it remains within stated policies and/or regulation. The firm will notify clients in advance should policies change with respect to aggregated transactions.

*3.10	Best Execution*

The firm  will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the client is receiving the overall best execution for their order. The circumstantial aspects involved in seeking best execution on a trade-by-trade basis for each account is generally not quantifiable. The firm will focus on establishing processes, disclosures, and documentation which together form a systematic and demonstrable approach in the aggregate – better known as “quality of execution” on behalf of all its clients. In seeking “best execution,” the determinative factor is not always the lowest possible cost but whether the transaction represents the overall best qualitative execution; taking into consideration the full range of a services, including the value of research provided, execution capability, rates, financial responsibility, and responsiveness.    

Periodic back-testing may be conducted of actual executions in relation to the market prices in order to determine whether client orders are being filled at the best prevailing market price or, if not at the best market price, then to the level of the overall execution quality given the other services received in connection with the transaction. The CCO or qualified designee may choose to review a sampling of client orders for the most active trading day in an effort to ensure that the resultant price and overall execution results for the client is as favorable as possible under prevailing market conditions for the time of execution. A record of the sample selected will be kept to evidence the review.  

The review may also include a report from the executing service provider showing the execution results by the firm and its client orders sent to the service provider; such as an SEC Rule 606 Report, to determine the overall performance of execution activities. Regardless of the method used by the firm, the CCO will maintain records evidencing effort to verify best execution on behalf of the firm’s client transactions.

*3.11	Trading Error Corrections* 

Definition of a Trade Error: Trading errors generally include the following situations \- 

* Inadvertently buying or selling the wrong security

* Failing to buy or sell securities as intended

* Buying, selling or allocating the incorrect number of shares

* Buying or selling a security in the wrong account

* Delays in trading within a client’s account as a result of firm actions or inactions

* Allocating securities to the wrong account (i.e., during aggregated trades)

* Buying or selling securities not authorized by the IPS or account restrictions

* Failing to follow specific client instructions to purchase, sell or hold securities

Trade errors do not include administrative errors that are generally immediately correctable through communications with the custodian (such as a clerical error). All trade errors should be promptly corrected following discovery of the error and the client informed when appropriate. Generally, any losses are absorbed by the firm and client’s account will be reimbursed for the loss. Gains will be credited to the client’s account or donated to a charity of the custodian’s choice. Payments made to clients as a result of trade error correction are to be accurately recorded in the firm’s accounting records, and the firm will ensure it does not use fees from other accounts or soft dollars to correct a trade error.   
Oversight and Documentation of Trade Errors: The CCO is responsible for documenting the trade error, including a description of the error, financial impact (if any), the client(s) involved, and resolution action(s) taken. The CCO will ensure an appropriate resolution is made for the trade error, which will include analyzing how the error occurred, whether a pattern exists which needs to be addressed, and that trends are eliminated.  

*3.12	Client Fees* 

All client fees will be noted in each client services agreement. The firm will facilitate billing via direct invoice and billing of custodial accounts. The billing method applicable to each of the firm’s clients will be delineated in each client’s advisory agreement, as well as general reference within the firm’s Form ADV Part 1 and 2\. At no time will a traditional investment management account be assessed an asset-based fee exceeding two percent (2%) of the client’s assets under management. On a periodic basis, the CCO or designee will review a sample of client records for the purposes of reviewing the general consistency of the fees being charged to the client in comparison to the services noted in the client agreement. Should discrepancies be discovered, the CCO or designee will create a record detailing the steps taken to correct the situation, if needed.  

*3.13	Vulnerable Adults and Financial Exploitation*

It is not uncommon that with aging comes diminished capabilities, including the inability to adequately manage financial resources, and a heightened susceptibility to financial exploitation. Protecting older investors as well as other vulnerable adults is a priority for our advisory firm.

A “vulnerable adult” is typically defined as a person 65 years of age or older and/or a “protected person,” any natural person over 18 years of age that is subject to state protections that include, but are not limited to: a person who suffers from dementia or other cognitive impairment, a person with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities, or any person over 18 years of age that is mentally or physically incapable of adequately caring for himself or herself and his or her interests without serious consequences to himself or herself or others. 

Many states, as well as the SEC, require that investment advisers who reasonably believe that financial exploitation of a vulnerable adult may have occurred, been attempted, or is being attempted, must report the incident to either their securities commission, a department of human resources or similar authority, or law enforcement. Laws also authorize firms to delay a disbursement from an account when the requested disbursement may result in financial exploitation of a vulnerable adult, and permit notification of certain third parties. Firms that take these steps in good faith are generally immune from state civil and administrative liability. Our firm has developed a training program and internal procedures to equip personnel to recognize the signs and “red flags” that may indicate the need for such protections. 

Firm personnel are in a unique position to identify cognitive decline or other potential impairments that affect clients, and our prompt actions may prevent a client from becoming the victim of financial exploitation. Detecting and recognizing the signs of cognitive impairment or diminished capacity begins with developing strong relationships with our clients. As part of our relationship building process, we will increase the frequency and quality of communication with aging clients, looking for signals of potential cognitive impairment issues, such as lapse of memory, disorganization, arithmetic mistakes, conceptual confusion, or diminished judgment. Because of slow onset or geographic separation, it may be difficult for family members to recognize these changes or notice unusual financial activities that might indicate that a client is being exploited. 

Mental capacity is a fluid concept that changes over time and depends on each person’s situation. Our firm defines “financial capacity” as the capacity to transact certain business, such as: understanding one’s personal financial needs and goals, understanding investment product choices, contracting for the purchase of a particular investment, or giving a particular professional the discretion to manage an account. Studies have shown that as cognitive decline advances, financial risk-taking often increases, and the ability to manage resources is compromised.  
   
Our clients may be reluctant to talk about cognitive decline but may be willing to discuss what to do with their finances in the event of a medical or other emergency. Discussions in this context provide an avenue to discuss powers of attorney and other advanced directive options. Ideally, these types of discussions take place upon account opening, at regular intervals thereafter, and as circumstances dictate. Ongoing communication with each client is critical both to establish a baseline from which to assess any changes in behavior or cognitive decline, and to recognize when protective measures may become necessary. 

Staff Training   
Annually, the Chief Compliance Officer will require that all staff complete vulnerable adult training that equip firm personnel with the tools necessary to recognize red flags and other warning signs that may leave a client vulnerable to financial exploitation. The training program will be designed to teach staff on how to detect signs of diminished capacity, cognitive decline, and financial impairment. Topics covered will include: 

* Assisting staff to recognize the various signs and/or red flags (examples below) of cognitive impairment; 

* Developing tips and strategies on how to communicate with clients experiencing diminished capacity, to include discussing the subject of powers of attorney and other advanced directives; 

* How to ask appropriate questions while still maintaining the client’s sense of autonomy and dignity;  

* How the firm places “watches” on an account when there is a suspicion that a client may be vulnerable; 

* Documentation procedures following contact with senior clients when they have problems with lack of recall or need assistance with resolving a misunderstanding; and 

* Firm escalation procedures so that staff are able to document suspected diminished capacity. 

The Chief Compliance Officer will consider incorporating existing training materials developed by state agencies and NASAA’s “Senior$afe” training program into the firm’s sessions. 

Identifying Cognitive Decline “Red Flags”   
It is important for staff to spot the signs of cognitive decline or a reduced capacity to handle financial decisions. While no definitive list exists, the following red flag examples of diminished capacity or cognitive decline are: 

*  The client appears unable to process simple concepts, such as: 

  * a decline in the ability to do simple math problems 

  * difficulty in understanding important aspects of their account 

  * difficulty with checkbook management 

  * confusion and/or loss of general knowledge regarding basic financial terms and concepts such as mortgages, wills, annuities 

* A client’s behavior is erratic, including: 

  * memory loss 

  * difficulty speaking or communicating 

  * inability to appreciate the consequences of decisions 

  * disorientation with surroundings or social settings 

  * uncharacteristically unkempt appearance 

*  The client exhibits impaired judgment about investments or the use of money, including: 

  * expressing interest in “get rich quick” schemes 

  * anxiety about the nature and extent of their personal wealth 

  * making decisions inconsistent with their current long-term goals or commitments 

  * refusing to follow appropriate investment advice   
  * failure to fulfill financial obligations such as paying bills, or paying the same bill twice 

Detecting Financial Exploitation   
Our firm defines the term “financial exploitation” broadly to include the wrongful or unauthorized taking of property, and any act or omission taken by a person, or through a power of attorney, guardianship, or conservatorship, with the intent to deprive a vulnerable adult of property. It is important that staff is familiar with the acts that constitute financial exploitation and that personnel are trained to identify the signs of financial exploitation. Signs that a vulnerable client could be the victim of financial exploitation include: 

* Uncharacteristic and repeated cash withdrawals or wire transfers 

* Appearing with new and unknown associates, friends, or relatives 

* Uncharacteristic nervousness or anxiety visiting firm offices or conducting telephonic transactions 

* Lack of knowledge about his or her financial status 

* Staff having difficulty speaking directly with the client 

* Unexplained or unusual excitement about a sudden windfall or reluctance to discuss its details 

* Sudden changes to financial documents such as powers of attorney, account beneficiaries, wills, or trusts 

* Closing of accounts without regard to penalties 

Reporting Financial Exploitation   
It is expected that firm personnel provide a report and any supporting documentation within 24 hours of the known or suspected vulnerable adult maltreatment. The report will be provided to the Chief Compliance Officer and, at a minimum, the report will contain:  

* client name   
* relevant dates   
* description of event(s) that led to report   
* description of steps taken or expected to take to date in response to the event   
* relevant documentation related to potential financial exploitation to ensure firm and outside agencies receiving the report have all necessary information to evaluate the report 

When there is reasonable belief that a client has been the victim of financial exploitation, our firm has an obligation to report this information to law enforcement who are authorized to receive and investigate reports of suspected abuse, neglect, and exploitation of adults who are suspected of being physically or mentally unable to protect themselves, and to arrange protective services, including guardian and conservatorships, to the extent possible when protection is needed. Reporting will be completed by the Chief Compliance Officer. 

Notifying Third Parties of Potential Financial Exploitation   
Developing strong relationships with our clients is one of the most important weapons in the detection of diminished capacity and in the fight against financial exploitation. Building strong client relationships and planning for more than simply the client’s “technical financial future” before potential issues arise is critical, and particularly important as it relates to third-party notification and advanced directives that memorialize a client’s preferred course of conduct when faced with diminished capacity or financial exploitation. 

Clients should be encouraged to use the firm’s “Permission to Share Information – Suspected Cognitive Decline or Financial Exploitation” form, particularly if other advanced directives, powers of attorney, etc., have not been prepared. These discussions should be thoroughly documented in client file notes.  If a client declines to complete the “Permission to Share Information – Suspected Cognitive Decline or Financial Exploitation” form, file notes should reflect that as well as provide a thorough summation of the discussion and the client’s stated reason for not completing the form. As with any client relationship, if a client’s attitudes or patterns of behavior impair the firm’s ability to act in the client’s best interest, the firm may consider escalation of the discussion to a firm principal, and even termination of the engagement if deemed appropriate.

It is important that firm personnel stress to their clients that our firm must have a copy of a current, executed directive in order for the firm to effectively address a financial exploitation event. Staff are charged with knowing the location of each client’s directive in the client’s file, and the investment adviser representative assigned to the client will no less than annually ensure that they have confirmed with their client that the information in the directive is current and accurate. 

Our use of a “designated trusted contact” allows our firm to notify certain additional third parties, without the client’s consent, when a report is about to be or has been made to authorities. Specifically, our firm is authorized to notify any of the following individuals: a legal guardian, conservator, co-trustee, successor trustee, agent under power of attorney, or other “reasonably associated individual.” The decision to notify a third party lies with the Chief Compliance Officer who will make a determination as to whether it is appropriate pursuant to state/federal regulations and firm policy to notify a trusted third-party about unusual or potentially exploitative activity occurring in a vulnerable adult’s account. 

Sharing financial and other potentially sensitive information with someone other than a client is a sensitive matter and raises privacy concerns. Federal privacy laws generally prohibit the sharing of financial information unless a client has consented, or another exception exists under current regulation. Sharing sensitive financial information with third parties, including family members, presents additional challenges since the firm may not know all details of the vulnerable adult’s relationship with a third-party or family member. While some state statutes allow third-party notification of closely connected individuals, in addition to trusted third parties who have been designated in writing or are on the account, the Chief Compliance Officer will determine the appropriate third-party contact based on the relationship of the associated person with the client and with the knowledge of the client’s family, relatives, close contacts, etc.

Delaying Disbursements in Situations of Potential Financial Exploitation   
Delaying or placing a temporary hold on a disbursement from a vulnerable adult’s account in an effort to prevent losses from financial exploitation is an important and very effective tool. Given the potential and unintended consequences of delaying disbursements, the Chief Compliance Officer will determine if such a delay complies with state law and that it is used only in limited and appropriate circumstances. 

The firm will immediately, and in no event more than two business days, notify all parties authorized to transact business on the account that the account is subject to a delay or temporary hold on a disbursement from the vulnerable adult’s account. In addition, and within the same time frame, the Chief Compliance Officer must notify authorities per that jurisdictions reporting mechanism of the disbursement delay or temporary hold. Firm personnel must ensure that notifications are not sent to the suspected perpetrators of the financial exploitation.  
   
The firm must carefully monitor the timing of delayed disbursements to ensure that funds are not withheld longer than permissible. Reasonable time is allotted, however, to allow the firm and investigating agencies to conduct a review of the transaction. The authorized time limitations on delaying disbursements are determined by the state in which the client resides and, typically, a delay expires upon the sooner by either a determination by the firm that the disbursement will not result in financial exploitation, or 10 business days after the date of the delay unless authorities request that our firm extend delay. In no instance should the delay extend beyond 30 business days unless judicial intervention is sought by either state agency, law enforcement, the firm or other interested party.

Access to Records   
Maintaining records relating to the vulnerable adult’s account is critical to detecting and combatting financial exploitation. In financial cases, records are often the primary evidence of wrongdoing. The Chief Compliance Officer will control the access to these records by investigating agencies in order to allow a thorough investigation of the case.   
 

## Section 4.0 Recommendations of Service Providers

The firm may recommend to clients various service providers which would include custodians, broker/dealers, other investment advisers (institutional money managers), etc. The firm will perform sufficient due diligence to establish a reasonable basis for making such recommendation, as well as disclose throughout the period of the client engagement of any perceived or known conflict of interest that may arise from these relationships.  

*4.1	Custodians and Broker/Dealers*

In recommending a custodian or broker/dealer, the firm will take into account the range and quality of services provided to the client. As a result of its due diligence efforts, the firm will create a summary document for having selected or recommended a broker/dealer (custodian). This record will be updated as necessary and maintained by the CCO. The CCO will ensure that the firm retains these review documents for the tenure such firms are recommended, and for a five-year time period thereafter. This record will note the following information:

* Firm name;  
* Firm address  
* Firm contact person and information;  
* Brief services description; and   
* Description of conflicts of interest (if any and whether they require disclosure in Form ADV Part 2A).


*4.2	External Investment Advisers*

If the firm recommends an external investment adviser for the management of client accounts, the result of the firm’s due diligence efforts will be created in a summary document. This record will be updated as necessary and maintained by the CCO. The CCO will ensure that the firm retains these review documents for the tenure such firms are recommended, and for a five-year time period thereafter. This record will note the following information:

* Firm name;  
* Firm address  
* Firm contact person and information;  
* Brief services description; and   
* Description of conflicts of interest (if any and whether they require disclosure in Form ADV Part 2A).

*4.3	Internal Investment Managers*

When the selected portfolio manager is an associate of the firm a conflict of interest exists since employing such a portfolio may result in the portfolio manager and/or IAR possibly receiving a greater percentage of the asset-based fee or indirect benefit from employer performance-based salaries or bonuses. In light of this potential conflict of interest, the firm will ensure it utilizes the same due diligence and selection/termination criteria for each portfolio manager, including firm personnel, in addition to further scrutiny by compliance and supervisory staff to ensure that appropriate portfolio selection, fees and other compensation meet within the account investment policy statement, firm procedures, and regulatory guidelines.  

*4.4	Outsourced Service Providers/Vendors*

The firm may choose to outsource certain functions: data network services, administrative support, compliance functions, insurance services, among others, where reasonable and practical. The CCO or designee will ensure adequate due diligence has been completed before engaging these services or allowing firm or client data to be accessed. This record will be maintained by the firm and retained for the tenure such firms are recommended, and for a five-year time period thereafter. This record will note the following information:

* Firm name;  
* Firm address  
* Firm contact person and information;  
* Brief services description; and   
* Description of conflicts of interest (if any and whether they require disclosure in Form ADV Part 2A).


*4.5	“Soft Dollar” Arrangements*

The types of services the firm may obtain from brokers or custodians in which client transactions are recommended or directed by the firm may include research, analyses, and other information on issues affecting portfolio companies or investment strategies; pricing services; performance measurements; or corporate governance issues. Software or web-enabled services used for investment research or brokerage transactions may also be obtained. 

These services may be deemed by certain jurisdictions as “soft dollar” arrangements and consideration will be made that they be disclosed; typically through the firm’s Form ADV Part 2\. Records evidencing review may be incorporated into the firm’s ongoing due diligence of the service provider. A record will be maintained for the life of the arrangement/agreement and for a period of five years thereafter.

## Section 5.0 Privacy Policy & Breach Procedures

The firm recognizes its obligation pursuant to the Gramm Leach Bliley Act (GLBA). Privacy laws regulate what the firm is allowed to do with the confidential personal information that it collects, uses and maintains in connection with its advisory activities, as well as under what circumstances it may share it with someone else.  

*5.1	Privacy Policy Notice*

The firm will ensure that its “Privacy Policy” is provided to its clients not later than the time it establishes a relationship.  The CCO will ensure the firm provides privacy notices annually to each client, defines the cyclical reporting period, and that the firm is consistent in applying it to all clients. 

*5.2	Firm Privacy Policy*

The firm will not disclose information outside of the below exceptions. As part of firm policy, confidential personal information will be restricted only to APs who need to know the information to provide advisory services.  

Physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards will be maintained to comply with regulatory standards to guard client non-public personal information (NPI). The firm will provide a reasonable means to prevent NPI from being disclosed to non-affiliated parties. The firm will attempt to enter into a written arrangements that require service providers to maintain confidentiality of client NPI.

Clients may opt out of the release of their information, and the firm will not require the client to write a letter to opt out. There are no opt out rights for the release of NPI the firm makes to service providers, however, the firm will disclose to its client via its privacy policy statement the nature of any information to be shared. Opt out rights typically do not apply to disclosure of NPI in the following circumstances:

* Client has consented to and not revoked the disclosure.  
* Resolving client disputes or inquiries.  
* Personnel holding legal or beneficial interest relating to the client.  
* Persons acting in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of the client.  
* Providing information to regulatory agencies assessing the firm’s compliance with regulations.  
* When required to firm legal counsel, consultants, accountants, auditors, etc., in performing their services.

*5.3	Cybersecurity Measures*

Our firm requires continuous security of firm and client data, and access to such information will be controlled. In coordination with information systems personnel, the CCO will record the following action items on no less than an annual basis:

* Identify in writing internal and external staff having access to firm systems and data. 

* APs trained in cybersecurity risks, responsibilities and action steps based on their role.

* Conduct an inventory of all physical systems and devices that are used within the firm. Restrict or eliminate removable or portable media where appropriate.

* Inventory software platforms and applications used by the firm. Correct/update, restrict or eliminate weaknesses involving these platforms/applications.

* Map networks, connections and data flows (including locations where client data is housed) and ensure they are updated. Correct/update, restrict or eliminate weak areas.

* Resources (hardware, data and software) are prioritized for protection based on their sensitivity and business value.

* Catalog connections to the firm’s network from external sources. Restrict such access where appropriate.

* Logging capabilities and practices are assessed for adequacy, appropriate retention, and secure maintenance.

* Review/update of firm encryption requirements based on systems/devices based and the data utilized.

* Ensure annual business continuity plan testing incorporates cybersecurity threats.

* Create and update vendor inventory to determine types of services, access and potential risks using vendor. 

* Request a report from service providers of their assessment of system/control room access to determine validity of physical security plan.

* Request a report from service providers involving penetration tests to determine system weaknesses. 

* Review vendor security policies with respect to cybersecurity to determine adequacy or consideration of other providers.

*5.4	Identity Theft Protection*

The firm’s security program is designed to maintain reasonable safeguards to protect personal information of its clients as well as its associates. 

***Assignment of Data Security Officer***  
The firm has identified the CCO as the Data Security Officer (DSO) who will be responsible for the policy, oversight, testing and execution of the firm’s data security. 

***Safeguards***  
The DSO will ensure that policy and action items address administrative, technical and physical safeguards the firm must utilize to protect against a loss of sensitive, non-public personal or firm information.

***Risk Assessments***  
The DSO will take reasonable steps to foresee both internal and external risks to firm and client data. A risk inventory and how risk items are to be addressed will be referenced in a separate working document maintained by the DSO.

***Service Provider Agreements***  
The firm will also provide a reasonable means to prevent NPI from being disclosed to non-affiliated parties. The firm will enter into a written arrangement that requires any service provider to maintain confidentiality of client NPI and sensitive firm information.  

*5.5	Disposal of Consumer Report Information and Records*

NPI records will be disposed in a manner that is designed to prevent unauthorized access or use.  Procedures include the following:

* APs will be trained in proper disposal procedures.  
* Secure removal of trash involving consumer report information.  
* Paper information will be burned, pulverized, or shredded so that it cannot be read or reconstructed.  
* Electronic information is destroyed or erased (preferably military-grade protocol) so that information cannot be read or reconstructed.  
* Information system hardware (copiers, scanners, printers, PCs, etc.) will not be discarded or donated unless the firm is assured NPI has been eliminated from equipment.

*5.6	Breach Procedures*

Privacy breaches have the potential to cause adverse impact on the firm, clients, or business partners. In order to respond to a data breach in an efficient, appropriate, timely manner, the firm has established breach response procedures. An important aspect of the firm’s response is organizing and initiating the execution of a response to the loss of NPI \-- either through an unintentional release or purposeful and unapproved access to secure data.  

*5.6.1	Breach Planning* 

Given the types of NPI that may be collected by the firm there is a potentially elevated risk of a data breach. An important first step in responding to a privacy breach is to ensure appropriate contingency planning. To facilitate a timely response to a breach, internal training and awareness are critical. 

Identifying Levels of Risk   
Each data breach will have a different level of associated risk depending on the data elements compromised.  

When determining risk levels, the firm will need to also understand the category of information that has been exposed (i.e., client, AP, etc.). The chart on the following page provides the basis for the protection of data elements. Data elements are separated into three classifications with unique handling requirements and associated risks: Public, Sensitive, and Confidential.  

| Data Classification | Risk Level | Description | Data Element Examples |
| :---: | :---: | ----- | ----- |
|  Public |  Low | Internal or external originating data which the public has access and does not expose an individual to any risk with its release. Authorized parties may circulate such information outside of the organization. | Name, address, and other information commonly found on business cards.   Approved marketing materials would also be classified as public. |
|  Sensitive |  Moderate | Internal use only content which contains enough proprietary information as to make it imprudent to release to the public. | Corporate policies, employee newsletters, strategic planning information, and employee contact information. |
|  Confidential |  High | Internal use content or data accessible only to defined employee groups. Unauthorized disclosure may seriously and adversely impact the firm, client, or business partners. Unauthorized disclosure of this data may lead to regulatory or legal implications. | Passport number, driver license number, SSN/FEIN, personal financial information (i.e. credit card numbers), marital status, and date of birth. |

Assessing the Breach: The firm will assess the type of data that had been compromised and all of the circumstances of the data loss, including:

* Level of difficulty for unauthorized persons to access NPI. 

* Means in which the loss occurred as well as whether the incident might be the result of criminal activity or is likely to result in criminal activity. 

* Evidence that compromised information is actually being used by an unauthorized party. 

* Where and how the breach occurred, and when it had been detected.

* Number of individuals possibly affected.

* Types of NPI at risk.

Considering the noted factors together should assist in developing a gauge of where the greatest risk(s) exist, how to proceed, and where to best deploy responses.  

*5.6.2	Notifications*

Following risk level identification and assessment, the firm will implement its response. When the firm has made the decision to provide notice to those at risk, it may incorporate the following into the process:

Timing of Notification: Notice provided in a timely and appropriate manner. It must not be done hastily based on incomplete facts or in a way that may exacerbate the situation. While it is important and often legally required to promptly notify those who may be affected, false alarms are counterproductive. The CCO may consider consulting legal counsel or industry consultants regarding the timing and content of any announcement before making any public disclosures.

Coordination with Ongoing Investigations: Under certain circumstances law enforcement may require a temporary delay before notice is given to ensure that criminal investigations may effectively be conducted (i.e., international hacking ring, etc.).

Method of Notification: Given the serious security and privacy concerns raised by data breaches, notification to affected individuals should be issued in a controlled manner by selected parties. The firm will consider the best method of notification given the type of breach and number of individuals affected, as well as its regulatory obligation. Various methods may include website postings, mailings, email, or phone calls.

Content of Notification: The notice should be concise and easily understood. The following items should be considered for inclusion into the notice:

* Brief description of what occurred.

* A description of the types of NPI involved in the breach.

* Brief description of what the firm is doing to investigate the breach, mitigate loss, and protect against further breaches.

* Key contacts and procedures for additional questions or to learn more information.

* Steps individuals should take to protect themselves from the risk of identity theft, including steps to take advantage of any credit monitoring or other service the firm or its provider will offer. 

Notifying Government Agencies and/or Credit Agencies: Various state laws require certain commissioners or credit agencies be notified in some or all situations. Depending on the legal requirement, number of individuals affected, and types of data elements possibly exposed, credit reporting agencies or local government offices may need to be notified of the breach in addition to the individual. Governmental or regulatory body notifications will be completed by the CCO or legal counsel.

Post Notification Considerations: Once affected individuals and authorities have been notified, the firm will prepare for additional inquiries. APs will be briefed on the incident and provided prepared responses to questions.  

## Section 6.0 Books & Records

The firm will keep accurate books and records relating to its advisory business, and they will be preserved and maintained in an easily accessible place for a period of not less than five years from the end of the fiscal year during which the last entry was made. For the first two years they will be maintained in the main office of the firm, and may be adequately secured off-site thereafter.  

This requirement includes publication of notices, circulars, advertisements, newspaper articles, investment letters, bulletins, or other communication. The maintenance of required books and records will ensure the firm’s activities are consistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 			

The CCO will restrict access to the firm’s books and records to those who specifically require it in order to discharge their responsibilities in support of its advisory business.  Restricted records access aids in preventing unauthorized alteration or inadvertant destruction. Further, the CCO will keep books and records relating to advisory activities reasonably segregated and secure from other records of the firm that may not be required under advisory regulations.  

The CCO will maintain a record of all persons who have been granted access its books and records that are required to be maintained by the firm.  

*6.1	Electronic Retention of Records*

Certain firm records may be retained in electronic format, however, the CCO will be required to:

* Create an index that identifies all electronic records, and arrange those records in accordance with the index.

* Produce a hard copy of any record retained in this media upon request.

* Maintain one copy of the electronic record on-site; maintain an accurate duplicate of the archived electronic record at another secure location; OR 

* Store the original and duplicates of the electronically archived record in a storage facility/device designed to prevent the untimely destruction or alteration of such records; AND

* Provide access to regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over such records, on demand.  

The CCO will create a record identifying all records to be maintained in an exclusively electronic format.  

*6.2	Organizational Documents*

The CCO will ensure the firm maintains documents and records memorializing the organization or formation of the firm. Corporate documents, and any amendments, will be maintained at the firm’s main office. They will be preserved for the life of the firm and for at least three years after its cessation by the CCO, designated legal counsel, or other appropriate arrangement per statute.  

All firm registration documents and correspondence with the jurisdiction of registration will be kept in a centralized file and maintained as noted above.   
   
When required by local code, business licenses will be prominently displayed in each office.

*6.3	Financial Statements and Trial Balances*

The firm will create and keep current general and auxiliary ledgers (or other comparable records) reflecting asset, liability, reserve, capital, income and expense accounts; as well as trial balances, financial statements, and internal audit working papers relating to its business. These records may consist of a Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, Statement of Changes to Shareholders Equity, and Net Capital (or Net Worth) Computations.

The CCO or qualified designee will keep current checkbooks, copies of bank statements, canceled checks and reconciliations as necessary. Bills or statements (or copies thereof), paid or unpaid, relating to the business should be kept on file. The firm will complete a trial balance sheet on a monthly basis to ensure it remains in compliance with its minimum net worth obligation.

Accounts should be reconciled on a scheduled basis, and a trial balance will be completed on a monthly basis to ensure the firm meets its financial responsibilities. The CCO or qualified designee will have the responsibility of ensuring the reconciliation is completed, accurate and maintained in a secure file.  

*6.4	Other State Filing Requirements*

Transfer of Control and Name Change: A notice of transfer of control (to include share of ownership changes) or change of name of the firm will require filing with the state via Schedule C of Form ADV; typically, not less than 30 days following to the date on which the transfer of control or change of name is to become effective, or such shorter period as the state may request.

Change of Supervisor: The firm may notify state administrators in writing in the jurisdictions it conducts business and where required for any change of its senior supervisor (CCO), typically within 10 days of such change and not later than 30 days.  The firm’s CCO will be responsible for ensuring filing of these notifications and amendments.

Financial Statements: Financial statements will be filed with New York on an annual basis, and must include a balance sheet and an income statement prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These must be dated and submitted within 90 days of the firm’s fiscal year-end. 

Other State Forms: The CCO will ensure that the NY-ADV-COVER form is included with its annual financial statement.

Reportable Currency Transactions: ***The firm will not accept cash in payment for its services***.  For reference, pursuant US 31 CFR Chapter X, the firm would be required to keep records of all cash currency transactions in excess of $10,000 in a single or two or more related transactions involving $5,000 or more, and must file reports as prescribed under the financial recordkeeping regulations of the state, when transactions occur within their jurisdiction. All filed reports required by law will be confidential except that any law enforcement agency or other required state agency will have access and authorized to inspect and copy such reports pursuant to a lawful subpoena (note: state securities examiners are not law enforcement officials). All currency transaction and suspicious activity reporting will be reported to and conducted by the CCO, and held with the utmost urgency and secrecy. All CTR/SARs and other pertinent notes or records will be maintained in a secure, segregated file, with sole access by the CCO. 

*6.5	Journals, Records and Other Original Entry Documents*

As earlier stated, the firm is required to keep accurate and true records. The following describes those journals maintained by the CCO.

*6.5.1	Personal Securities Trading Record*

The firm will keep a record of every personal securities trading (PST) transaction in a security in which the firm or any AP has, or as a result of a transaction acquires any direct or indirect beneficial ownership. Later sections provide further detail on the current types of securities, requirements and processes. The firm believes it has kept a satisfactory record of any PST transaction if it receives and reviews trade confirmations and periodic statements which contains all the necessary information, and which is kept for five years, the first two years in an easily accessible location.

*6.5.2	Receipts and Disbursements Record* 

The purpose of the Receipts and Disbursements Record (or Journal) is to afford the ability to track receipts and disbursements relating to the firm’s business (i.e., fees paid to vendors, refunds from vendors, etc.). Essentially, this record is similar to a check register used for a bank account. The CCO will regularly review and retain these records, preferably during reconciliation cycles.  

The firm will not accept cash from clients for the purpose of advisory activities. In the event a client attempts to use cash currency to provide payment for the firm’s advisory service fees, the CCO or designee must not accept the funds and provide notice to the client of the firm’s acceptable forms of payment. It should be noted on the record as such and returned to the client. 

The firm will require all client payments to be tracked and recorded on the firm’s record relating to checks received and distributed.  

*6.5.3	Fee Payments* 

Calculation and Assessment: All client fees will be calculated and noted in each agreement.    
Written Notice of Payment: The firm will provide the client advance written notice (invoice) of the fees to be deducted from each account; this notice will include the total fee assessed, covered time period, calculation formula utilized, and the assets under management on which the fee had been based. The firm is obligated to provide this invoice to clients residing in New York.     

Billing via Custodian: Should an account be billed via the custodian of record the client agreement must authorize the custodian to debit accounts for the amount of certain fees owed to the firm. The authorization will remain valid until a written revocation of the authorization is received by the firm. In connection with this fee deduction process, the custodian will follow the terms of the agreement as communicated by the firm. Clients must be informed (via Form ADV Part 2A and the written agreement) that the custodian will generally not confirm the accuracy of fee deductions from their account.

*6.5.4	Order Memoranda*

If the firm provides transaction services for a client and does not execute such trades via an electronic platform (e.g., “held-away accounts”), it will create and maintain form of order memoranda involving the purchase or sale of any security, or any instruction received from the client concerning the purchase, sale, receipt, or delivery of a particular security, and of any modification or cancellation of any such order or instruction. The memoranda or similar record will be periodically reviewed by the CCO or designee. Typically, a sample of the period’s orders will be selected, and the reviewer will date and initial each order as part of this procedure. The order memoranda (or other similar record) should include the following:

* Terms and conditions (i.e., buy, sell, etc.) of the order, instructions and of any modification or cancellation of the order;

* Identity of the adviser who recommended the transaction to the client;

* Identity of the adviser who placed the order;

* Client account number, when applicable;

* Time and date of receipt from client, when applicable;

* Time and date of entry;

* Bank or broker by or through whom executed; 

* Extent feasible, the time of execution or cancellation;

* Extent feasible, the execution price.


*6.5.5	Purchase and Sales Record* 

If the firm provides transaction services for its clients via an electronic platform, the firm will record the following items in a general file(s) or trade reporting system(s):

* Records showing for each client, the securities purchased and/or sold, and the date, amount and price of each such purchase and sale.  All records will include the information required by the previous section in relation to order memoranda.

* For each security in which any client has a current position, information from which the firm can promptly derive the name of each client and the current amount or interest of each such client is necessary.

* A means to demonstrate transactions have been reviewed by supervisory staff.

The custodian of record does not serve as the record repository for transactional information. Data will be periodically downloaded from the custodian of record data sources and stored by the firm per record retention policies. 

*6.6	Communication with the Public*

Advertisement: The firm classifies any notice, circular, advertisement, newspaper article, investment letter, bulletin, or other communication that the firm circulates or distributes, directly or indirectly, to two or more public persons to be an advertisement. If the latter recommend the purchase or sale of a specific security and do not state the reasons, a memorandum for the firm’s record will be maintained describing the recommendation rationale.

The term “advertisement” includes any notice, circular, letter or other written communication addressed to more than one person, or any notice or other announcement in any publication or by radio or television, which offers: 

* Any analysis, report, or publication concerning securities which is to be used in making any determination as to when to buy or sell any security, or which security to buy or sell;  

  * Any graph, chart, formula, or other device to be used in making any determination as to when to buy or sell any security, or which security to buy or sell; or 

  * Any other investment advisory service with regard to securities.

General Communications: General notices, advertisements, articles, investment letters, bulletins, sales literature or brochures, request for proposals, and other communications that may not qualify as “advertisements,” *as defined above*, includes individual correspondence between the firm (APs) and clients or prospective clients, and may include the following content:

* Recommendation made or proposed to be made, and advice given or proposed to be given;

* Records that may define the foundation for the calculation of the performance or rate of return of any or all recommendations used in print or electronic materials; or   
* Supporting documentation or working papers that provide a basis for a recommendation contained in a communication that recommends the purchase or sale of a specific security but does not state the reasons for such recommendation.  Essentially, if a recommendation is made in the communication without any supporting reasoning for such, the firm must maintain any documentation used as the basis for such recommendation.

Sales Literature: Written communication distributed by the firm and designed for use by more than one person but not for broad, public dissemination.  In contrast to advertising, the audience for sales literature is controlled.  

Client Correspondence: Written communication sent or received by the firm to or from any single individual.  Generally included in the definition are such items as individually addressed letters (not form letters), e-mail, facsimile, post cards, or other communications prepared for delivery to a single client.

Internet Communication: Communication made on the internet which could be directed generally to anyone who has access to the internet, and includes bulletin boards, chat rooms, displays on website “home pages,” or other similar methods.  
    
Note: The firm does not consider incoming correspondence (bulk or “junk” mail) that does not involve the firm’s advisory business to be subject to the procedures contained within this manual.  

*6.6.1	Potential Advertisement and General Communication Issues*

It will constitute fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts, practices, or course of business for the firm or an AP to publish, circulate, or distribute any advertisement that:

* Refers to any testimonial of any kind concerning the firm or concerning any advice, analysis, report or other service rendered by the firm; 

* Refers to past specific recommendations of the firm which were or would have been profitable to any person. 

Note: This does not prohibit an advertisement that furnishes a list of all recommendations made by the firm within the immediately preceding year or longer period if the advertisement and list furnished separately state the: 

* Name of each security recommended,  
* Date and nature of each recommendation (i.e., buy, sell or hold),   
* Market price at that time,   
* Price at which the recommendation was acted upon,   
* Market price of each security as of the most recent date, and   
* Contains a cautionary legend on the first page in print or type text stating: 


“*It should not be assumed that recommendations made in the future will be profitable or will equal the performance of the securities in this list*;” OR *“Past perfomance is not necessarily indicative of future results.”* 

* Represents any graph, chart, formula or other device offered can be used to determine which securities to buy or sell (or when to buy or sell them); or represents any graph, chart, formula or other device being offered will assist any person in making their own decisions as to which securities to buy, sell (or when to buy or sell them), without prominently disclosing in such advertisement the limitations and difficulties with respect to its use; 

* Contains any statement to the effect that any report, analysis, or other service will be furnished free or without charge, unless such report, analysis or other service actually is or will be furnished entirely free and without any condition or obligation, directly or indirectly;

* Contains any untrue statement of a material fact or is otherwise false or misleading.

Public communications will contain the appropriate disclosure information as described by the CCO and in accordance with the jurisdiction where material or communications may be used.

***All advertising will be reviewed*** by the CCO or qualified designee ***prior to*** dissemination to the public or potential clients to ensure the compliance with the listed criteria. The CCO or designee will keep a file of all approved advertising, sales literature, and correspondence.


*6.6.2	Social Media Networks*

APs desiring utilization of social media networks (i.e., LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.) as a means of public communication involving their advisory activities will be required to inform the CCO of the name of each site they intend to use. The CCO will ensure information posted on any social media site is reviewed and archived.

An IAR will not post any testimonials (or permit testimonials) about his/her or the firm's services in any social or professional networking medium.

Links from an AP's page to any third-party site are subject to the same requirements for due diligence and pre-approval as other firm referrals. The CCO will also ensure the firm is not “entangled” by third-party sites/messages. Under the theory of “entanglement” and “adoption,” APs and/or a firm may be held accountable for content on third-party sites in some circumstances. If content on a third-party’s site was prepared by and/or paid for by the firm or an associate, the firm and associate may be deemed to be “entangled” by that content and jointly liable for content found to be misleading, fraudulent, etc.  

If there is no preparation or payment for content but the firm or associate refers to the third-party site (such as by stating a recommendation to view the material or providing a hyperlink to a third-party website) the firm and associate may be deemed to have “adopted” the third-party content.

Before providing reference or linkage to any third-party material via his/her website, in marketing materials, etc., an AP must first obtain authorization from the CCO to do so and will be granted only if warranted by the due diligence performed on the third-party itself and the content of the third-party’s materials.  
   
The CCO or qualified designee will monitor and review social media content posted by third parties on social media websites utilized by the firm and/or its associates. The CCO will also ensure the firm is not “entangled” by third-party sites/messages.

The firm will maintain all AP content posted on social or professional networking media websites for the required retention period.

*6.6.3	GIPS®*

Performance data used by the firm that is claimed to be compliant with the Global Investment Performance Standards (“GIPS® compliant”) will be maintained in accordance with those requirements currently published by the CFA Institute.  The CCO or qualified designee will ensure an accurate record of the current standards, performance data, etc., are maintained by the firm. At no time will any material be distributed in any medium or labeled GIPS® compliant, or a similar inference, if it does not meet current standards. Materials errantly issued will be recovered and its recipents informed in writing by the CCO of the error or required correction(s).  
          
*6.6.4	Issues Related to Seminars* 

Any of the advertising approved by the CCO may also be used in seminars.  The fact that they may be used in a seminar setting as opposed to a direct or indirect delivery to an individual does not affect the limitations on the use of or the retention requirements for such items.   
Generally, as long as materials used are in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of jurisdictional statute and their corresponding rules the material should be acceptable for use in a seminar setting.  Seminar records, including presentation materials and attendance rosters, will be maintained for at last three years following the reportable period.

*6.6.5	Issues Related to Internet/Website Communications* 

The firm and its APs will not be considered transacting business in any particular jurisdiction when using the internet to distribute information about its services if the website or other electronic communication methods contains a footnote that denotes the firm and its APs may only transact business in those footnoted state(s) registered, excluded or exempted from state registration requirements. Any individualized or follow-up responses to persons in any particular jurisdiction by the firm or an AP that involve rendering personalized investment advice for compensation will not be made unless the firm and/or IAR has met jurisdictional requirements.

*6.7	Review of Advertising and Sales Literature*

The CCO or designee will review and approve all advertising and sales literature materials prior to their distribution.  The CCO will also determine if certain materials require filing with a jurisdiction or outside party (e.g., broker/dealer) having oversight of stated firm activities. For any items that qualify as either advertising or sales literature, any such items that are distributed to 10 or more individuals need not include the retention of a list (names and addresses) of any such recipients as long as the recipients do not appear on any distribution list such as a “leads list.”  If any such list was used to create a distribution list for the materials, the firm must also retain a document describing the list and the source of the list.  

The New York Investment Advisory Act may necessitate an advisory firm who sells to clients or prospective clients a form of investment advisory literature to submit such materials (one set) to the Department of Law’s Investment Protection Bureau on the date of the first general distribution to the investing public. Every investment adviser who publishes, gives publication to, or makes general distribution of any notice, circular, advertisement, form letter or other advertising communication for the purpose of soliciting investment advisory accounts or clients within the State of New York, whether in writing or by radio or television broadcast, to file with the Department of Law’s Investment Protection Bureau one set of each described above promptly, as is reasonably possible, but not later than five days after the advertisement, notice, circular, letter or other advertising communication has been made. The CCO will review and submit such materials as required and will keep a record of all state-filed materials as described.

*6.8	Correspondence (Paper)*

The CCO or designee will review and retain both incoming and outgoing correspondence related to the firm’s investment advisory activities. As earlier stated, the firm will not be required to keep unsolicited market letters and other similar communications of general public distribution not prepared by or for the firm. Also, the firm will not be required to keep incoming correspondence (bulk or junk mail) that does not involve the firm’s investment advisory business to be subject to the procedures contained in this manual.

 

*6.9	Correspondence (Electronic Mail)*

The CCO or designee will ensure that copies of incoming and outgoing electronic mail (e-mail) are retained on a secure system maintained in accordance with provisions previously cited involving electronic records. The firm will maintain a continuing record of the e-mail archiving and review system that has been in use for each reportable year, and must be able to promptly produce archived e-mail for the required reportable period upon request.

*6.10	Client Complaints*

A complaint is any written statement by a client or an agent acting with legal authority on behalf of a client, that alleges a grievance against the firm or one of its APs involving the activities of noted persons in connection with advice given, disposition of client funds, etc.  It is the responsibility of each AP to notify the CCO of receipt of a complaint.

Any complaint received by a custodian of record from a client or the client’s legal representative that has been forwarded and received by the firm will be promptly acted upon as if the complaint was received directly from the client.  

A centralized Complaint File will be maintained for all written client complaint records and firm written responses for a period of at least five years, the first two years in a readily accessible location, and will include the minimum information:

* Complainant’s name, address, and account number;  
* Date the complaint was received;  
* Name of each AP (if one) identified in the complaint;  
* Description of the nature of the complaint; and  
* Interim and final disposition of the complaint.

Such files/records and working papers are the property of the firm and are not to be maintained in paper or electronic form at a branch location, location of convenience, residence or electronic storage not owned by the firm.  Branch personnel are to refer legal and/or regulatory inquiries involving such records to the CCO for response.

The CCO will ensure client complaints are reviewed and responded promptly in writing.  The CCO will be responsible for initialing the written or printed electronic complaint, and signing the response as evidence of such review.  The CCO will keep record of incoming written complaints along with a record of the disposition of the complaint. The CCO will also determine if certain matters require submission with an outside party (e.g., broker/dealer, insurance agency, etc.) having oversight of stated firm or associated person activities.  

*6.11	Regulatory or Legal Agent Requests for Information*

The CCO will ensure the firm promptly responds to all requests or reports from regulatory authorities or a client’s legal agent, and will ensure the firm creates and maintains a working file and all supporting documentation related to the handling and resolution of such requests. All records provided in an official request, whether during an examination/legal process or otherwise, will be coordinated through the CCO and recorded as they are received or disseminated.  All pertinent documents and responses will be maintained by the firm in a Legal/Regulatory Action file for record.

*6.12	Branch Office Contact Persons* 

The CCO will ensure that the firm maintains a record that identifies each office location of the firm listing all individuals by name or title at that location. Noted on the Associated Persons List and/or the appendices will be an identifier of the individual(s) who, without delay, can explain the types of records maintained at that office and the information contained in such records (i.e., “Records Explainer”).  

*6.13	Gifts and Political Contributions Policy* 

Gifts  
Gifts that are given to or received from others in conjunction with firm business are subject to certain limitations and are authorized at the CCO’s discretion. Other than those excluded below, the CCO will be notified, in writing, of business gifts and gratuities received. Notification will normally be provided to the firm in advance of giving a gift to a client or prospective client. Gifts should not exceed $100 per annum per client. A record will be maintained by the CCO for all gifts received from or provided to clients, vendors, etc.

Gifts are prohibited when given for the purpose of influencing or rewarding the action of a person in connection with the publication of information which has or is intended to have an effect upon the market price of any security. APs may not solicit gifts from clients or other persons with business dealings with the firm; nor are they permitted to accept gifts from current vendors or those seeking future business without the written approval of the CCO. This policy does not include customary business lunches or entertainment; promotional items (i.e., shirts, pens, etc.) or gifts of a nominal amount.

Political Contributions  
The firm itself does not engage in direct or indirect political contributions. Any political contributions for or by the firm or anyone associated with the firm in a solicitation capacity is strictly prohibited. The firm’s policy is not designed to disallow personnel from engaging in their right of free speech but does place certain contribution level restrictions pursuant investment adviser regulation. The firm will be guided by Rule 206(4)-5 of the Investment Advisers Act with respect to political contributions, as well as adhering to state and local regulations, and current contribution limits, with respect to political contributions. 

The firm permits individuals to make aggregate contributions up to $350, per election, to an elected official or candidate for whom the individual is entitled to vote and up to $150, per election, to an elected official or candidate for whom the individual is not entitled to vote. These *de minimis* exceptions are available only for contributions by individual covered associates, not the firm. Under both exceptions, primary and general elections would be considered separate elections. *APs are obligated to promptly inform the firm of any political contribution as they occur.*

The firm will maintain a record of contributions made by covered associates to government officials (including candidates), and of payments to state or local political parties and PACs. These records of contributions and payments will be listed in chronological order, identifying each employee-contributor (including their title, business and residential address) and recipient, the amounts and dates of each contribution or payment and whether a contribution was subject to Rule 206(4)-5’s exception for certain returned contributions. The CCO will ensure associates no less than annually attest to their obligation and accuracy of reporting any political contribution to the firm. The CCO will maintain a Political Contributions record for five years following each reportable year.

## Section 7.0 Personal Securities Trading

Firm personnel may invest for their own accounts or have a financial interest in the same securities or other investments that the firm recommends to its clients and may engage in transactions that are the same as transactions recommended to or made for client accounts involving reportable securities. Such transactions are typically permitted but may require to be pre-cleared and reported in compliance with the firm’s policy on personal securities.  

Reports of personal transactions in securities by firm personnel are reviewed by the CCO quarterly or more frequently if deemed appropriate. In an effort to reduce or eliminate certain conflicts of interest, the firm may choose to create a list of securities that restricts APs from trading or purchasing (i.e., restricted list).

Except for the senior-most firm officer, no AP may pre-clear their own trades, review their own required reports, or otherwise serve as the final point of review of their own actions involving such activity.

*7.1	Personal Trading Restrictions*

Trading Pre-Clearance  
APs are required to pre-clear all personal securities transactions ***involving restricted securities*** through the CCO or designee prior to the transaction, with the following exceptions:

* Purchases which are part of a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP); or

* Any acquisition of a security through stock dividends, dividend reinvestments, stock splits, reverse stock splits, mergers, consolidations, spin-offs or similar corporate reorganization or distributions generally applicable to all holders of the same class of securities and without any investment decisions being taken by the AP.

This obligation applies to transactions in which the AP has either direct or beneficial ownership.  The clearance will be effective through the end of the business day on which it was granted and is automatically revoked if the AP or CCO discovers that the information provided at the time the personal trade was approved is no longer accurate.  

Pre-clearance will be granted when there are no active client orders in the market in the restricted security and there are no violations of the firm’s policy involving personal security transactions.

Restricted Securities  
Restricted securities are defined as all publicly traded debt and equity securities, derivatives of and securities exchangeable into publicly traded debt and equity securities (options, warrants, convertibles, etc.), as well as IPOs, ETFs, ETNs, and limited offerings; with the following ***Reporting Exceptions***:

* US Treasury securities   
* bankers’ acceptances   
* certificates of deposit (CDs)   
* repurchase agreements 

* commercial paper   
* open end mutual funds (including all money market funds) and variable insurance contracts ***held directly with the issuer*** (aka. “fund-direct” or “subscription way” securities) 

Restricted Period: The price paid or received by a client account for any restricted security should not be adversely affected by an AP buying or selling the same restricted security on the same day.  Therefore, APs may possibly not be allowed to trade a restricted security on the same day as a client unless the trade is part of a block (aggregated) trade executed by the firm.  Furthermore, when the firm has an open order for the purchase or sale of a restricted security for any of its clients, APs may possibly not be allowed to affect personal transactions in such a restricted security until the day after the client’s order is completely filled, unless the trade is part of a block (aggregated) trade executed by the firm.

Short Swing Profits: APs may not profit from the purchase and sale or sale and purchase of the same restricted security within 30 calendar days. Nothing in this restriction shall be deemed to prohibit the avoidance of loss through trading within a period shorter than 30 calendar days. 

Exceptions: Exceptions must be requested of and approved by the CCO, in writing, and are typically only granted for the execution of a closing position involving a derivative product (i.e., option, warrant, etc.) where the AP has held a position in such a product for more than 30 calendar days (in the event of a gain) and where the product will expire concurrent with or before the end of the restricted period.  

*7.2	Securities Holdings Reports*

Initial Holdings Report\*  
Except as noted below (see ***Reporting Exceptions***), APs will report to the CCO within 10 days of hiring or before opening an account thereafter with the following initial holdings information (which must be current within 30 days prior to be provided) involving:

* Name of each custodian, broker/dealer or bank the AP maintains an account where any securities were held for the direct or indirect benefit of the AP.

* Account number and type registration (individual, joint, etc.) for each AP account.

* Type of securities (equities/debt), number of shares or principal amount of each security the AP has had either direct or indirect beneficial ownership.

* Date the report was submitted by the AP.

Quarterly Reports***\****  
Except as otherwise noted (see ***Reporting Exceptions***), every AP will report, no later than 30 days following the end of each calendar quarter, to the CCO the following:

With respect to transactions in any security in which any AP has, or by reason of such transactions acquires, any direct or indirect ownership in the security involved;

* Date of transaction, title and type of securities, interest rate and maturity date (if applicable), and number of shares (equities) or principal amount (debt securities) of each security involved.

* Nature of transaction (purchase, sale or any other type of acquisition or disposition).

* Price of security at which the transaction was effected.

* Name of the custodian, broker/dealer or bank through which the transaction occurred. 

* Date the report was submitted by/for the AP.

With respect to any account established by the AP in which any securities were held during the quarter for the direct or indirect benefit of the AP:

* Name of the custodian, broker/dealer or bank with whom the account was established.

* Date the account was established.

* Date the report was submitted by/for the AP.


Annual Holdings Reports***\****  
Except as otherwise provided below (see ***Reporting Exceptions***), each AP will report to the CCO no later than 30 days following the end of the calendar year:

* Name of each custodian, broker/dealer or bank the AP maintains an account where any securities were held for the direct or indirect benefit of the AP.

* Account number and type registration (individual, joint, etc.) for each AP account.

* Type of securities (equities/debt), number of shares or principal amount of each security the AP has had either direct or indirect beneficial ownership.

* Date the report was submitted by the AP.

**\*NOTE: A lack of a transaction report submission by an AP will be interpreted as a lack of any transaction during the period.  Should it later be determined that a transaction in fact occurred, the AP will be referred to the CCO.** 

*7.3	Review of Transactions / Brokerage Accounts* 

On no less than a quarterly basis, the CCO or qualified designee will review AP accounts and transactions of the firm’s APs and any required related parties (i.e., certain immediate family members) the CCO has determined must provide such reports. The report review will be conducted to determine indications of potential conflicts of interest, insider trading activity, or other activity that may be considered inconsistent with firm policy.  

The CCO or designee will retain copies of the account statements reviewed as documentary evidence of the completion of this review for a period of five years following termination of the account or the AP/related person’s relationship with the firm. The CCO or qualified designee’s review of an individual’s brokerage account(s) held at the firm’s custodian of record will also be deemed to include the “transaction” review.  

## Section 8.0 Insider Trading 

The firm will comply with the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act. The firm is required to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that are “reasonably designed” to prevent and detect insider trading abuses, including the misuse of inside information by employees or the circulation of industry rumor that may harm markets and their investors. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in significant civil or criminal penalties. Regulators have the authority to examine firms for the adequacy of their insider trading surveillance systems.

*8.1	Regulation and Firm Policy*

Firm policy prohibits APs from effecting securities transactions in any fashion while in the possession of material, non-public information. APs are also prohibited from disclosing such information to others. The prohibition against insider trading applies not only to the security to which the inside information directly relates but also to related securities, such as options or convertible securities.

Trading prohibitions are for any account, whether for the firm, any client, their own account, and any accounts in which they have direct or indirect beneficial interest \- including accounts for family members.

The prohibition against insider trading includes: 

* Being in possession of material non-public information about a company or the market for a company's securities, one must either publicly disclose the information to the marketplace or refrain from trading. 

* Generally, disclosure is not an option and the effect is to require an individual to refrain from trading. The firm may not communicate inside information to a second person who has no official need to know the information.

* Information is considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in deciding to buy or sell a security. In addition, information that when disclosed is likely to have a direct effect on a security's price should be treated as material. Examples include information concerning impending tender offers, leveraged buy-outs, mergers, sales of subsidiaries, significant earnings changes and other major corporate events.

* Generally, a person violates the insider trading prohibition when that person violates a duty owed either to the person on the other side of the transaction or to a third-party (such as a client or employer) by trading on or disclosing the information. The insider trading prohibition applies to an issuer's directors, officers and employees, investment bankers, underwriters, accountants, lawyers and consultants, as well as other persons who have entered into special relationships of confidence with an issuer of securities.

Virtually anyone can become subject to the insider trading prohibition merely by obtaining material non-public information by unlawful means or by lawfully obtaining such information and improperly using it. This is known as *misappropriation*.  

If the firm or an AP receives material, non-public information as part of its legitimate business dealings on behalf of the firm or its clients, and that is used to trade in securities or transmit information to another person for purposes of trading in securities (so-called "tipping"), the AP or firm would likely be guilty of *insider trading*.  

Insider trading liability may also be *derivative*, such as a person who has obtained inside information (so-called “tippee") from a person who has breached a duty or who has misappropriated information may also be held accountable. 

The firm may be deemed an insider when it comes into possession of inside information through its various activities with public and private corporate clients. The firm will remain an insider as long as it has inside information, regardless of whether the client or prospective client decides to engage another registered investment adviser firm or whether the firm declines to accept the proposed engagement.

*8.2	Confidentiality of Material Non-Public Information*

Material non-public information should be communicated only when there exists a justifiable reason to do so on a "need to know" basis. Before information is communicated to persons within the firm or another person believed to have a need to know, it must be pre-approved by the CCO. Contacts with other managers may represent an important part of the firm’s research and ongoing due diligence efforts. In the course of monitoring professionally managed funds or investments, the firm may obtain access to holdings, trading strategies and other forward-looking strategies or trading plans. It is understood that, in certain circumstances, information regarding proposed trades or other activities relating to securities held by the aforementioned funds may constitute material, nonpublic information. Consequently, when the firm becomes aware of forward-looking activities which may impact the price of a publicly traded security, such as planned trades, litigation, or any other potential fund manager strategy which may impact the price of a security, it is the firm’s policy to immediately add the security and/or issuer to its published restricted list.

*8.3	Sanctions for Insider Trading*

The sanctions for violations of Insider Trading laws are severe and include criminal penalty. Not complying may result in harsh consequences for individuals involved, including investigations by the SEC or state authorities, criminal and civil prosecution, disgorgement of profits realized or losses avoided through use of the nonpublic information, civil penalties of up to $1 million or three times profits or losses, whichever is greater, exposure to additional liability in private actions; possibly incarceration and criminal fines may also occur.  

*8.4	Annual Certification*

All APs are required to annually certify their knowledge and compliance with firm policy, which includes insider trading.  
 

## Section 9.0 Business Continuity Planning 

Significant business disruptions may result from large-scale events that the firm must be prepared to address. A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) has been developed to help minimize impact from these disruptions. The CCO is responsible for the maintenance of the BCP. 

*9.1	Plan Components* 

The BCP is designed to address important areas of the firm’s operational activities, to include:

* Data back-up and recovery (hard copy and/or electronic).

* Key Systems List.

* Key Contact List.

* Firm Location.

* Alternate communication channels.

* Regulatory reporting.

* Periodic review and testing.

* Current review and approval of the BCP.

* Training and notification of APs.

The BCP will be made available to all APs so they are familiar with procedures in the unlikely event of a significant business disruption. The CCO will ensure APs are informed upon hiring and annually thereafter through training review.  Material changes to the BCP will require more frequent distribution and review.

*9.2	Key Systems* 

All key systems will be included on a list identifying them as a key system. The CCO will maintain a current “Key Systems List” as part of the BCP. The firm utilizes certain critical information systems and hardware that the CCO has identified and include:

* Internal databases containing client records.

* Internal databases housing firm records.

* Firm programs and software.

From the Key Systems List, the firm has developed a process to ensure that in the event of a disaster it will be able to transition to necessary backup systems as others are rendered non-functional. The CCO will ensure that the list includes:

* System or area name.

* Description of the system/area.

* Name of person(s) or entity responsible supporting the system, including alternates.

* Back up location (address, phone numbers, directions, etc.) where key systems may be established or duplicated.

*9.3	Key Contacts* 

Key employees will be provided access to the BCP and will be informed as the plan changes. The individuals identified on the “Key Contacts List” will maintain copies of the BCP in locations outside the firm’s main office location. The CCO will be responsible for the maintenance of the “Key Contacts List,” on a regular basis and may include:

* Key internal personnel.

* Key external service provider contacts.  
* Key regulatory contacts.

Information to be collected for the key contacts (and alternates) should include:  

* Full name.

* Primary and alternate address.

* Primary and alternate phone and fax number(s).

* Email addresses.

For each internal key contact, the CCO may denote descriptions of the job functions each person. The firm may designate alternate individuals to fulfill these roles in the event of unavailability of internal key contacts. All individuals should be educated as to roles and may be asked to rehearse as part of the firm’s efforts to train and educate its personnel on the proper BCP procedures.  

*9.4	Data Back Up/Recovery and Off-Site Storage Facility* 

The CCO may identify locations geographically separated from the main office as a back-up site. The location should be a reasonable distance away to utilize a completely separate power and telephone grid. This site may be utilized to establish remote operations for key systems that have been identified as mission critical.  

The site should be designed with the necessary computer and communication systems to enable the firm to operate and support basic needs of its clients. Any backup facility utilized for the purposes of the firm’s BCP should be accessible only to key employees and secured when unattended.  

Under the CCO’s approval, the firm may allow staff to operate from their homes or other designated locations should a catastrophic event occur. The CCO will ensure that contingency locations are designated and recorded as part of the BCP.

The firm will periodically back up critical firm data in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements regarding electronic storage and record retention. In the event of a communications or operations failure, the firm will implement some or all of its BCP recovery measures. The implementation of disaster recovery measures will largely depend on the extent of the communications or operations failure.

*9.5	Client Notification* 

The firm will inform clients at the beginning of the relationship via Part 2A of Form ADV of its BCP policy and contact information. A separate form letter describing our BCP is available to clients upon request.  
*9.6	Firm Assessments* 

Financial and Operational Assessments \- The firm will identify changes in its operational and financial risk exposures as necessary. Financial Risk relates to the ability to continue to produce revenue. As part of the firm’s assessment of potential financial risks it may face due to a catastrophic event or other significant disruption to its operations, it will also need to take into consideration costs establishing backup facilities, expenses implementing the BCP, availability of funding in the event of BCP implementation, outstanding debt as a result of lost revenues, other expenses arising out of the occurrence of a significant disruption to its operations and loss of revenues, etc.

Operational Risk focuses on the firm’s ability to maintain communications with clients and to retrieve key activity records through its key systems. As part of the firm’s assessment of potential operational risks it may face due to significant disruption to its operations, it should consider:

* Time delays due to accessing and start-up of backup systems.

* Capabilities of alternate communication systems. 

* Communication with staff and service providers.

* Personnel availability.

Key Business Relationships \- An assessment of its BCP relative to key service providers whose operations are critical to firm support may include:

* Custodial or clearing firms.

  * Financial institutions the firm holds accounts.

    * Providers of critical systems (ie., networks, etc.). 

      * Other service providers deemed critical to the firm.

*9.7	Contingency Succession Planning* 

Should there become a situation where the CCO is deceased or becomes incapacitated and can no longer supervise the firm, the firm will initiate its contingency succession plan. Any replacement CCO must be qualified per current jurisdictional guidance. 

Staff/APs – Associates must be promptly notified via firm communications systems that an interim/new CCO has been assigned, as well as how requests and documents will be processed.

Custodian(s) – Custodians who maintain written agreements with the firm in support of its investment advisory activities must be contacted to ensure the custodian is aware of the change of supervision and oversight authority.  

Client(s) – Clients will be made aware of the matter via Form ADV Part 2A or material change page.  

Regulatory Body(ies) – Each regulatory authority having oversight of the firm will be promptly notified as noted in the firm’s list of contacts.  

*9.8	BCP Training and Education*

The CCO will ensure BCP familiarity and training of APs where applicable. Each internal key contact, descriptions of job functions for each key person should be noted in the event of a catastrophe. The firm’s BCP should be made available to staff to ensure all are familiar with the procedures in the event of a significant business disruption.  

*9.9	Periodic Review*

No less than annually the CCO will review the BCP, which will address the adequacy of the BCP, areas that require improvement, and sufficient training of staff. Results will be documented by the CCO, and a record retained per current recordkeeping requirements.

## Section 10.0	Annual Review  {#section-10.0-annual-review}

*10.1	Annual Review – CCO’s Role* 

The CCO will ensure that the firm’s compliance program is reviewed on an annual basis or more frequent basis. The primary focus of this review is to ensure that the written procedures are current and adequately address all areas of its business. The CCO will create a summary document in order to memorialize this review having taken place, and will provide a written synopsis of this analysis for record.     

*10.2	Policy Breaches* 

Any material breach of firm policy will be identified, mitigated and disclosed (when required). All policy breaches will be recorded by the CCO for future reference. The CCO should be prepared to report breaches and their mitigation steps to regulatory bodies as necessary. 

*10.3	Annual Reports and Record Retention*

Internal annual reviews will be reduced to written report by the CCO or qualified designee. All firm reviews, examinations, risk assessments and supporting documents or records will be retained by the CCO for a period no less than five years from the date of the final report. All of these documents may be subject to review or discovery.

### Appendix N Code of Ethics

**Code of Ethics**  
Invest Vegan LLC (the “firm”) and its associates have a duty of utmost good faith to act solely in the best interests of each client. Our clients entrust us with their funds and personal information, which in turn places a high standard on our conduct and integrity. Our fiduciary duty compels all associates to act with the utmost integrity in all of our dealings. This fiduciary duty is a core aspect of our Code of Ethics and represents the expected basis of all of our dealings.  

Our firm adheres to its Code of Ethics and accepts the obligation not only to comply with the mandates and requirements of all applicable laws and regulations but also to take responsibility to act in an ethical and professionally responsible manner in all professional services and activities.   

This code does not attempt to identify all possible conflicts of interest, and literal compliance with each of its specific provisions will not shield associated persons from liability for personal trading or other conduct that violates a fiduciary duty to advisory clients.

#### Standards of Conduct

* The interests of clients will be placed ahead of the firm’s or any associates.

  * All known or potential conflicts of interest will be disclosed to our clients.

  * Associates are expected to conduct their personal securities transactions in accordance with the policy and will strive to avoid any actual or perceived conflict of interest with the client. Questions regarding the appearance of a conflict with a client should be discussed with the Chief Compliance Officer before taking action that may result in an actual conflict.

  * Associates will not take inappropriate advantage of their position with the firm.

  * Associates are expected to always comply with securities laws, which include anti-fraud provisions.

  * Investment adviser representatives will be appropriately registered or exempted in each jurisdiction they conduct advisory business as required by regulation.

  * Business titles will be accurate and avoid public misperception as to the associate’s position, education, and background.  

    

Protection of Non-Public Information \- Associates will exercise diligence and due care in maintaining and protecting client non-public personal information and will be familiar with the firm’s published privacy policies. Any known or suspected privacy breach must be immediately reported.

The firm may have written arrangements with third-party providers to perform certain client or firm services. While associates may not be directly involved in this activity, they are expected to not divulge information regarding securities recommendations or client securities holdings to any individual outside of the firm, except: 

* To complete transactions or account changes (i.e., communications with custodians).

* As necessary to maintain or service a client account (i.e., communications with a client attorney). 	

* With a service provider that supports the firm and only following the firm entering into a contractual agreement that prohibits the disclosure or use of confidential information and only as necessary to carry out its assigned responsibilities.

* As permitted or required by law.

Personal Conduct \- Associates are expected to conduct themselves with the utmost integrity and avoid any actual or perceived conflict with our clients. In this spirit, the following are required:

* Insider Trading – Associates must review and acknowledge their understanding and adherence to the firm’s Insider Trading Policy.

  * Acceptance of Gifts – All associates are prohibited from receiving any gift, gratuity, hospitality or other offering of more than *de minimis* value from any person or entity doing business with the firm. This gift policy generally excludes items or events where the employee has reason to believe there is a legitimate business purpose and must be pre-approved by the Chief Compliance Officer.

* Political Contributions – The firm does not engage in direct or indirect political contributions. Any political contributions for or by the firm or anyone associated with the firm in a solicitation capacity is strictly prohibited. The firm’s policy is not designed to disallow personnel from engaging in their right of free speech but does place certain contribution level restrictions pursuant investment adviser regulation. The firm will be guided by Rule 206(4)-5 of the Investment Advisers Act with respect to political contributions limits and political contributions. Therefore, the firm permits associates to make aggregate contributions up to $350 per election to an elected official or candidate the associate is entitled to vote, and up to $150 per election to an elected official or candidate the associate is not entitled to vote. These *de minimis* exceptions are available only for contributions by individual associate, not the firm. Under both exceptions, primary and general elections would be considered separate elections. *Associates are obligated to promptly inform the firm of any political contribution as they occur.*

  * Splitting of Fees – Sharing or splitting of advisory fees will only occur with other appropriately registered personnel and only as approved by the firm.

    * Director for an Outside Company – The firm prohibits an associate from serving as a director for an outside entity whose products, services or activities may be a conflict of interest.

      * Outside Business Interests \- Any associate wishing to engage in business activities outside of the firm must seek approval from the Principal prior to the engagement.

        * Payment of Services – Advisory client payment of services will be made to the firm only.

Employee Acknowledgement \- New associates will acknowledge they have read, understand, and agree to comply with our Code of Ethics within the 10 days of hiring with the firm. All associates will annually reaffirm their understanding of the firm’s Code of Ethics.

#### Personal Securities Trading Policy  
Associated and related persons of the firm will report, and the firm will periodically review personal securities accounts and holdings. The firm defines an associated person to mean any associate of the investment adviser; a related person includes immediate family members who receive any economic benefit from an associated person (i.e., spouse, minor, etc).

NOTE: A lack of transaction report submission will be interpreted as a lack of any transaction during the reporting period. Should it later be determined that a transaction in fact occurred, the associated person will be referred to the CCO. 

#### Code of Ethics and Personal Trading Policy Violations  
All associates are required to promptly report any violation of this policy to the Principal, including the discovery of a possible violation committed by another employee. Items that should be reported include but are not limited to non-compliance with federal securities laws, conduct that is harmful to our clients or the firm, etc.

As noted above, employees are encouraged to report any violations or apparent violations and such reports will not be negatively viewed, even if the reportable event upon further review is determined to not be a violation and the employee reported such apparent violation in good faith.

#### Code of Ethics and Personal Securities Trading Policy Sanctions  
Upon discovering a violation of policy, the firm may impose any sanctions as deemed appropriate, including disgorgement of profits, trade reversals, and up to and including termination.
