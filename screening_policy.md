# Ethical Capital Investment Collaborative
# Investment Screening and Exclusion Policy
## Version 3.0 - Consolidated Final

---

## 1. Policy Framework and Governance

### 1.1 Fiduciary Foundation
Our fiduciary responsibility to investors is to ensure our strategies do not place them under undue risk. This policy positions ethical screening as a primary risk management tool that insulates portfolios from product and conduct-based issues that may result in financial liabilities, reputational damage, and stranded assets.

### 1.2 Core Philosophy
We align with goodness and avoid preventable harm to living things. This principle guides all investment decisions through professional discretion. The systematic elimination of companies engaged in harmful activities reveals businesses that are structurally integrated into healthy social systems, demonstrating sustainable competitive advantages through reciprocal value creation rather than extractive practices.

### 1.3 Governance Structure
- **Decision Authority**: The Chief Investment Officer maintains sole discretion over all exclusion and inclusion decisions, including the authority to reverse exclusion criteria when warranted
- **Discretionary Management**: As a discretionary investment manager, professional judgment is exercised on a case-by-case basis within the framework of preventing harm
- **Client Input**: While clients cannot weaken firm-wide exclusions, they may adopt stricter parameters for their individual portfolios
- **Documentation Standards**: All exclusion decisions are tracked through portfolio management systems and reviewed monthly

### 1.4 Formal Commitments
Ethical Capital Investment Collaborative maintains the following institutional commitments:
- **Apartheid-Free Pledge**: Formal commitment to exclude companies complicit in systematic oppression
- **PetChem Investor Declaration**: Commitment to address petrochemical risks and plastic pollution
- Additional commitments may be adopted as they align with our core mission

## 2. Criteria for Product-Based Exclusion of Companies

Assets entrusted to our firm **shall not be invested** in companies which themselves or through entities they control:

### 2.1 Categorical Product-Based Exclusions
- **Harm to Living Beings**: Manufacturing meat, dairy, eggs, honey, butter, silk, cheese; contributing to demand for leathers, hides, and furs; production of equipment that directly harms animals
- **Weapons and Military**: Sale of weapons, military materiel, or consulting services that support military operations
- **Addictive Products**: Prey on addictions to alcohol, tobacco, and gambling
- **Fossil Fuels**: Upstream (extraction) and downstream (refining/retail) operations in oil and gas industry
- **Extractive Industries**: Principally engaged in mining, expropriation of public assets, or activities generating significant externalized costs
- **Surveillance Capitalism**: Enable and deepen surveillance through consumer tracking, privacy erosion, and related operations
- **Incarceration**: Operate for-profit prisons

### 2.2 Infrastructure Considerations
- **Midstream Energy**: Midstream infrastructure (pipelines, storage) is not excluded on its own. Midstream is considered less harmful than upstream (extraction) or downstream (refining/retail) operations
- **Essential Infrastructure**: Companies providing necessary infrastructure may be evaluated based on transition potential and engagement opportunities

3. Is the company taking meaningful action to eliminate harm?
4. Would excluding this company reduce harm in the world?
5. Are there alternatives that achieve similar ends without harm?
